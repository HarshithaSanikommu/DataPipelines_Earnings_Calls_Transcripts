Mike?</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Mike Roman</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am encouraged by our company’s progress and performance in the second quarter, coming off a difficult to start to the year. While we continued to face slow growth conditions in key end markets, our execution was strong. We implemented our restructuring while effectively managing costs and reducing inventory levels, which I will discuss on the next slide.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our team is building momentum going into the second half as we focused on what we control and as a result today we are affirming our guidance for the full year. At the same time, we remain focused on our four priorities for long-term value creation, portfolio, transformation, innovation and people and culture.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">In the second quarter, this included our acquisition of Acelity, an excellent complement to our health care portfolio and which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Please turn to Slide 4. As you recall on our last earnings call, we laid out specific and aggressive actions to strengthen our performance. In the second quarter, we made significant progress with each of those actions. First, the restructuring has been finalized across the enterprise, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $148 million.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We continue to expect annual savings of $225 million to $250 million with $110 million in the remainder of this year. Beyond the restructuring, we are driving increased cash flow through several other actions. For example, we adjusted our manufacturing output and reduced inventory levels by over $250 million in the quarter. We also curtailed indirect costs by more than $80 million year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">While we are making positive strides in our operations, there is still more to do and we will remain focused on managing costs and improving productivity. As we do this, we will continue to invest in organic growth, the research and development and CapEx to deliver on our promise to innovate for our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Please turn to Slide 5 for a summary of our second quarter. Organic growth companywide was minus 1% in line with our expectations. Growth was led by our Health Care business at 4% which was a good improvement versus Q1 and consumer grew 1%. We saw continued end market softness in China, automotive and electronics, which tempered growth in our other two businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Growth in Safety and Industrial declined by 5%, while Transportation and Electronics was down 1%. With respect to EPS, we posted adjusted earnings of $2.20 per share, which includes a $0.21 charge for restructuring and a $0.07 benefit from a pending divestiture, which Nick will cover in his remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Underlying margins were 22.2% which excludes 140 basis points of impact from the restructuring. So we are making good progress relative to our Q1 margins, up 21.4%. Importantly, we delivered this improved margin performance even while reducing production and inventory, which reflects the strength of the 3M value model.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I wanted to take this opportunity to thank our people for rising to the occasion and for executing our plans with focus and urgency. And while there is more work left to do, 3M’s foundation remains strong. We have deep competitive advantages [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing, global capabilities and leading brands.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We have market leading businesses and strong relationships with our customers. Moving ahead, we are focused on investing for the future and continuing to deliver operational improvements which will enable us to better serve our customers and maximize value for all of our stakeholders. That wraps up my opening comments. I will come back to discuss our guidance after Nick takes you through the details of the quarter. Nick?</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Nick Gangestad</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Second quarter organic sales declined 0.9% in line with our expectations. Volumes were down 140 basis points while selling prices were up 50 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales by 10 basis points. While foreign currency translation was a 180 basis point headwind to sales. All in, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars declined 2.6% versus last year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Looking at growth geographically, the U.S. was flat organically versus last year’s 6% comparison. Last year’s second quarter was boosted by increased customer demand ahead of our U.S. ERP go-live. Health Care grew mid single digits with Consumer up low single digits. Transportation and Electronics was flat while Safety and Industrial declined. Asia Pacific declined 90 basis points in Q2 with Health Care delivering positive mid single digit organic growth [indiscernible] while each organic growth in China was down 80 basis points with growth in Health Care and Transportation and Electronics, which was more than offset by declines in Safety and Industrial and Consumer.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For the year, we now expect organic growth in China to be down low to mid single digits versus a prior expectation of flat. As we continue to experience challenging end market conditions, particularly in the electronics and automotive industries.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">EMEA declined 3.6% on a nearly 6% comparison in last year’s second quarter. Latin America/Canada grew 70 basis points with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico each up low single digits.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Please turn to Slide 7 for the second quarter P&amp;L highlights. Companywide, second quarter sales were $8.2 billion with operating income of $1.7 billion. Operating margins were 20.8% which included a 140 basis point impact from our second quarter restructuring and other actions.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As anticipated, the biggest impact to Q2 operating margins was the year on year decline in organic volume along with cost absorption penalties from lower production volumes as all business groups work to reduce inventories in the quarter. These factors resulted in a 200 basis point reduction to margins versus last year’s second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Acquisitions and divestitures combined brought down margins by 50 basis points primarily due to the acquisition of M*Modal. Higher selling prices continued to more than offset raw material inflation contributing 30 basis points to second quarter margins. For the year, we continue to expect selling prices to more than offset raw material costs. And finally foreign currency net of hedging impacts increased margins by 40 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let’s now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings were $2.20 per share. That was a bit better than we anticipated, primarily due to improved productivity along with the held for sales status related to a pending divestiture, which I will cover shortly.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let me now cover the reconciling items to second quarter earnings. Negative organic growth along with absorption penalties from lower production and inventory levels reduced per share earnings by $0.19 [indiscernible] divestitures combined increased second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share versus last year. This result includes a $0.07 tax benefit related to the held per sales status of the pending divestitures of the gas and flame detection business that we announced in June.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Restructuring and other actions lowered Q2 earnings per share by $0.21. Our second quarter underlying tax rate was higher year on year, which decreased earnings by $0.07 per share.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And finally, we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 3% versus Q2 last year, which added $0.07 to per share earnings.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Please turn to Slide 9 for a look at our cash flow performance. Second quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion with a free cash flow conversion rate of 110% which includes a 14 percentage point benefit from the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Second quarter capital expenditures were $421 million, up $56 million year-on-year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">During the quarter, we paid $830 million in cash dividends to shareholders and returned $400 million to shareholders through growth share repurchases. We continued to expect full year repurchases to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Please turn to Slide 10, where I will summarize the business group performance for Q2. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business which declined 5% in the quarter. Similar to first quarter, we saw continued broad based softness and channel inventory reductions across most of the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">These factors particularly impacted our automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure and masking systems businesses. Personal safety was up low single digits in Q2 against the double digit comparison a year ago. And roofing granules turn positive this quarter, growing low single digits organically.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking geographically, Safety and Industrial’s organic growth was led by a 1% increase in Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific, EMEA and the U.S. each declined. Safety and Industrial’s second quarter operating margins were 22.1% with an underlying decline of approximately 200 basis points. Margins were impacted by negative organic growth, reductions in manufacturing output and inventory along with our second quarter restructuring actions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving to Transportation and Electronics. Second quarter sales were down 120 basis points organically compared to last year. The electronics-related businesses were down low single digits organically with growth in display materials systems more than offset by declines in electronics materials solutions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our automotive OEM business was down 5% year on year impacted by a 7% decline in second quarter global car and last year strong comp. Transportation safety was up mid single digits and advanced materials continued to deliver strong organic growth up high single digits in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Geographically, organic growth was flat in both the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, well Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Transportation and Electronics second quarter operating margins were 24.1%, down 240 basis points. Similar to Safety and Industrial, margins were impacted by manufacturing and inventory reductions along with a 30 basis point impact from restructuring.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to Health Care, as anticipated, this business improved versus first quarter as our team delivered 3.5% organic growth in Q2. Organic growth was broad across most of our Health Care business, led by a high single digit increase in health information systems.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Medical solutions, our largest business in Health Care was up mid single digits and we continue to look forward to Acelity becoming part of this business later this year, up low single digits. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Finally, drug delivery was down mid single digits in line with our expectations. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific and the U.S. led the way each up mid single digits. Health Care second quarter operating margins were 26.4% which included a combined 210 basis point impact from the M*Modal acquisition and restructuring.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Lastly, second quarter organic growth for our Consumer business was nearly 1%. Sales grew low single digits in Consumer Health Care, stationery and office and home improvement. While home care declined.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking at Consumer geographically, organic growth was led by a 2% increase in the U.S. and Latin America/Canada, while Asia Pacific and EMEA declined. Consumers operating margins were 20.6% in the second quarter which included a 40 basis point impact from restructuring. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">That wraps up our review of second quarter results. Please turn to slide 11 and I’ll hand it back over to Mike to discuss 2019 guidance. Mike?</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Mike Roman</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, Nick. Today, we are affirming our guidance for the full year. We expect organic growth of minus one to plus 2% along with adjusted earnings of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Please note that this guidance does not include the pending Acelity acquisition or the pending divestiture of our gas and flame detection business. We also continue to expect a return on invested capital of 20% to 22%. And a free cash flow conversion rate of 95% to 105%. While there is uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our guidance, as we will see continued momentum from the actions we implemented in the first half. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">[Indiscernible] PFAS, specifically, PFOA and PFOS, which are the subject of a litigation we face. As CEO, there are few things that I want people to know about this issue and our company.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">First, 3M voluntarily phased out of the production of PFOA and PFOS in the early 2000s and was the first company to do so. Since then, we have been committed to using our expertise and resources to improve the knowledge of PFAS, support remediation and give people confidence in their water.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">3M has invested $100 million in testing water sources. We have invested another $50 million for filtration systems as these substances can be effectively removed, which 3M has been doing for more than a decade. We have entered into voluntary agreements with states and communities where we manufactured these compounds.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We have also contributed to peer-reviewed journals, backed by hundreds of studies conducted by 3M and other researchers on the potential effects of PFAS. At the same time, we are continuing to work with the EPA along with state and local governments to support thoughtful regulations and solutions based on science and facts.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We also believe that an independent scientific body should partner with regulators to review all available [indiscernible] continues to evolve. The scientific evidence does not show that PFAS caused harm to people at past or current exposure levels. More broadly speaking, being an environmentally responsible company is core to 3M. We started our groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays program more than 40 years ago and we continue to step up our leadership to address climate and environmental challenges.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Earlier this year, we committed to move our entire global operations to renewable energy. And last year alone, 3M solutions helped our customers avoid 15 million tons of emissions. Sustainability is a value that matters deeply to our people, to our customers, and to me personally. It is a point of pride for 3M and we will defend with vigor our company’s reputation in the court of law and in the court of public opinion.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll now take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p5"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Kaplowitz</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Hey, good morning guys.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Good morning, Andy.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Good morning, Andy.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Kaplowitz</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Mike or Nick, can you talk about the cadence of the quarter as it went on? Some industrial companies have talked about a bit of a stabilization late in Q2, did you see that at all in Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, and last quarter you said these stockings from your customers cost you something like a 100 basis points of revenue growth was similar impact in Q2 as it does look like your auto OEM business performed a bit better than the underlying market. So have you seen any signs of industrial or auto destocking this closer to ending?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yes, Andy. Throughout the quarter, the trends were pretty stable as we saw our sales progress through each of the three months. I can’t say we really discerned any positive or negative trend as the quarter progressed. If I shift it internally, we did see our momentum in terms of reducing in regards to channel inventory I said about last quarter about 100 basis points of what we impacted channel destocking.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We were again seeing channel destocking impacting us in the second quarter in particular in the SIBG business, safety and industrial business group. We think that was a very similar destocking impact to what we saw in the first quarter and as far as automotive, we were in most noticeably impacted by destocking in China and that just was not the same event in the second quarter. It was a pretty much more normal relation of auto builds to our penetration and less channel destocking going on in relation to auto.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Kaplowitz</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. Nick, that’s helpful. And then you mentioned in the presentation that you’ll save $110 million in the second half of the year $0.15. It will help to have a decent step-up in EPS in the second half even outside the benefit to make the midpoint of your guide. So how much of the step-up is in your control? Can you give us some more color on how much of your business transformation and stocking optimization initiatives can help you in the second half? I think there'll be programs in terms of savings that are continuing to ramp in second half and in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. Andy, a few things are going on. First of all, we have been progressively taking more and more inventory out of our own operations. We think some of that that’s going continue into the second half of the year. So that will continue to be a headwind that we are facing in the second half of the year. We will be getting the restructuring benefits of $0.15 that we talked about as well as I’ll just say overall disciplined cost management in light of what we would call a slowing economy right now.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So some of that our own discipline in execution will be impacting us in the second half. On the margin, there are some other things that will impact us. FX, which has been a neutral to a headwind in the second – in the first half of the year, that will be likely if FX rates stay where they are, that they will be coming positive to us in the second half of the year. But mainly it’s just going to be improved execution over what we saw in particularly in the first quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Kaplowitz</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks Nick.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks Andy.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks. Good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning, Joe.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning, Joe.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hey Nick. Maybe just kind of staying on the – how to think about the margins for the rest of the year, obviously, like a big headwind this quarter was the manufacturing and inventory reductions. And you guys have given some estimates for what you expect, productivity to be like this year and clearly, you are also moving ahead with indirect cost reduction. So I don't know, is the right way to think about it as you progress through the year that these things are going to offset each other? Or should we be thinking about them as a tailwind? I'm just trying to understand how to think this through.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Joe, if I think about where we are going to end for the full year, let me just start out by saying when I look at collectively where all the sell-side analysts are in their view of the total year. My view is it looks like you collectively have it dialed in about right. What I’m seeing collectively amongst all of you means it lines up very closely with our own internal view of how things will progress for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">If I look at in particular in Q3, Joe, right now we are expecting organic growth in the second quarter to be somewhere between flat to a low single digit organic growth. And as far as margins, what we’ve been seeing happen throughout the year and what we expect to continue to happen as we progress into Q3, Q1 to Q2, absent the restructuring actions, was a sequential improvement in margins as we focus on execution.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We think that sequential improvement going into Q3 is going to continue. So we expect our margins to be 23% or higher in the third quarter. And so what we are seeing there is some momentum building on our margin story. And so I'd say, Joe, those are the headlines to think about and how you are thinking about the second half of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Got it. That’s super helpful, Nick. And I guess maybe, Mike, very, very helpful, commentary earlier on PFAS. I guess just as – obviously, it's hard to assess how this all shakes out, but I’d be curious to get your views on like timing on when we could think about when we’ll start to get some sort of resolution, as it continues obviously to be a bit of an overhang on the shares?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. Joe, I wouldn't think about timing. In respect to timing, let me kind of talk about what we can say today. And it's not a lot, but it’ll give you a couple of things to look at. The first trial, if there is a trial, related to the Wolverine cases in Michigan that would be at the end of first quarter. These are kind of fuzzy time lines. They're not fixed. But that's kind of the expectation when the first trials related that if there is a trial would come to us. AFFF, the MDL, the multi-district litigation, we wouldn't expect any actions on that until late 2020. So those are kind of a frame of the litigation and timing. And as we learn more – as I said in my comments, we're gaining and understanding all the time. And as we learn more, we’ll update you as we go.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of Merrill Lynch, please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Good morning. Can you hear me?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes good morning, Andrew.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Could you just walk us through core gross margins ex restructuring sequentially versus the first quarter and how should we think about progression on that side of the equation through the year? Thank you. That’s the first question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, Andrew. A little bit of this will be a repeat from what I said to Joe, but our core underlying margins…</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Gross margin, yes.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Gross margin. Thank you for clarifying that Andrew. So our gross margins in the first quarter if we pull out the costs related to some litigation activity that we had in the first quarter, our core underlying gross margin was 48%. In the second quarter that went down. If I pull out the restructuring down to 47.5%, and that's being impacted, we think we estimate by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the second quarter by the aggressive actions we're taking and pulling out inventory in our production. So underlying operations, we're seeing good execution on what we're working there. And we expect those gross margins to continue to be impacted by us taking actions on our inventory. But we also do see our gross margins improving slightly into the third quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So if we pull that out, just to clarify, if we pull that out, you're sort of recovering slowly from that 48% into sort of more historical range of 49%, 50%. That's a fair statement if you take out inventory,</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Andrew that's a fair statement.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And then on inventory, I assume that improved free cash flow forecast for the, I think, it's Slide 23 upon Slide 24, that's all working capital, right?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, we’re keeping our projection of free cash flow conversion. Well I think you're actually going into a deeper slide. Improved working capital is the biggest thing impacting our free cash flow conversion and dollars for 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And if you were to quantify how much incremental working capital reduction opportunities do you have for the next 12 to 18 months?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">I'll isolate it just to inventory, right now, Andrew, in answering that question, 250 that we took out in the second quarter, we think there's another $100 million or $200 million that we can be taken out of the second half of 2019. And then as far as 2020, it's a little early to say, but we've been targeting to get down to 85 days of inventory outstanding. That's where we're targeting to get to the end of this year. If we're going to bring that down further in 2020, I’ll likely be giving that guidance later in this year or early next year.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi. Good morning. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey Julian.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey Julian.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi. Maybe just focusing on Q3, so I think you talked about flat to slight organic sales growth firm wide. Maybe just help with a couple of aspects of that. One would be, does that assume further channel destocking and how severe would that be in Q3? Not your own under production efforts, but that channel destock. And then what are you assuming for the Transport and Electronics business within that, after what was a pretty good Q2?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">It's probably good to step back. I recognize we've been seeing, the global economies slowing as we came through second quarter, but this is a trend that we've been seeing since late last year. And I would say if you look at now third quarter as we move sequentially forward to deliver on what Nick was just talking about, it really is a stabilization of the markets that we’re facing and the trends that we’re seeing. And to go below that it would have to – the economies would have to degrade even further.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And if you look at channel Nick talked about what we saw in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, we think when you look at the total year as it plays out a majority of the inventory adjustments in the channel are taking place in the first half. So it will be a lesser impact even though there’ll be some impact in the second half. So that plus a easier comp as you get into Q3 if you look at it with our ERP deployment last year that would all add up to that trend.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And just on your question about TBG we would see them down in the second half from where they are in – sequentially from where they are in second quarter. But in line with the market outlook that we’ve talking we don’t – I think early in the year people had been talking about, been hoping for a stronger recovery in automotive and electronics. But we see a more conservative view of that now with build rates down and continuing to be soft as we go into second half may be stabilizing a bit versus where they are in the second quarter, but still down. So we see sequentially down in TBG.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hey Julian just to add a little bit what Mike said there for Transportation and Electronics in the third quarter particularly, we expect that to be down low to mid-single digits in the third quarter. And that’s in line with what we’re expecting as far as guidance for the full year for Transportation and Electronics. We’ve guided that we think for the full year that somewhere between flat to down 3%. And if I had to estimate right now, I'd say we're much – we’re leaning more towards the low end of that range for Transportation and Electronics for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">That's extremely helpful. Just following-up on that Nick, as you said, that's trending towards the lower end. Also I think from a regional standpoint you took down your China assumption for the year. So maybe help us understand in the context of the overall reaffirmed organic sales growth guide for 3M for 2019 which of the regions or segments that are coming in maybe at the higher end or looking a little bit brighter today than back in April?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, so healthcare as far as the guidance that we've given for the full year on that, that's when we see more likely in the high end of the range; and Transportation and Electronics more likely towards the low end; Consumer. I'd put right in the middle of the range that we've laid out. And the SIBG we see it in the range, but that also could be in this bottom half of the range. And as we guided a negative one to plus two for the full year, last quarter and as we're affirming it, there was also a sense that we had there may be some places where things come in a little weaker and we're seeing that happen and that gives us the ability to continue to maintain that guidance, going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Perfect. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, Nigel.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, Nigel.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi. Just want to keep kind of follow-on that one really. Just kind of think about what the all means to that minus one plus two. So, it seems like you sort of biased in towards slightly below the midpoint based on what you see today, would that be fair, Nick, sort of looking at maybe flat to up slightly for the full year?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes Nigel, I mean the midpoint of that range is up 50 basis points, so flat to up 50 to a 100 basis points, like that's I think of very fair zone for where our most likely landing spot is.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay, that's helpful. I'm not sure I missed some of the prepared remarks. Did you quantify the impacts of inventory headwind this quarter? So that down 90 bips, what was the sell through that you saw, excluding inventory headwinds?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now there's, Nigel, there's two different inventory points we talked about on channel inventory contractions that last quarter in the first quarter we said it was about a 100 basis point impact to revenue. We think second quarter was something similar to that. And Mike also clarified that we think well we still have some ahead of us for channel contraction, we think the majority is behind us. In terms of within our company as we have been reducing inventories ourselves, reducing our production, we've said that – I've said that we think that impacted our margin in the second quarter by a 100 basis points to 150 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. That's very clear. Thanks for the detail. And my follow-on question is really on the location and implications of some of the one time of this quarter. There was $0.07 tax gain, did that land in the tax line or was that somewhere else Nick?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then secondly, the restructuring is 1.12 operating, 3.6 non-operating. The payback was based on $0.20 of restructuring. Is that the right way to think about it or does the payback sort of come down because some of it is non-operating and maybe just touch on the nature of that non-operating restructuring charge.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay, Nigel I’ll just parse out the two pieces you're asking about, the $0.07 benefit we incurred in relation to the held for sale status for our Gas Detection business, that ran through the tax line, the income tax line of our income statement. The $148 million impacting our operating expense and the balance $36 million of non-op. And that's exactly in line with what we were expecting. We were estimating approximately $150 million. The fact that some of it is hitting non-op versus operating doesn't impact at all the projected benefits we have going forward of approximately $110 million yet this year and on an annualized basis, $225 million to $250 million.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">As far as where that restructuring happened, I would say geographically it happened around fairly well dispersed around 3M. And as far as business of the $112 million that was in operating expenses of that restructuring, about 75% of that was in our corporate and unallocated section, and about 25% of that was in our businesses. Now the benefit, that $110 million of benefit, that will be felt by our businesses through the second half of the year and it will be fairly proportionate to the size of each of our businesses as far as the benefits that you’ll see in the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Thanks Nick.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Alright, next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Good morning guys.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning Josh.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Nick, just a point of clarification on the inventory de-stock that you saw externally by your customers. You said that 100 basis points in the first quarter kind of look similar in the second quarter. But auto, I think, China auto specifically got better. So within that something must have gotten worse. Where did we see that get worse?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">As far as anything that got sequentially worse versus the first quarter Josh, nothing comes out particularly strong. I think in aggregate in China we continue to see China destocking on a more broad basis. So we didn't see it in our automotive business of any significance. What we saw across our Safety and Industrial business that view Josh was very similar in terms of the total destocking impact that we were seeing of a 100 basis points both quarters.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Got it. That's helpful. And then I know it's a little early to think about 2020 but I guess thinking back with historical context for how destocking and re-stocking cycles go, should we expect to just be selling to kind of market demand as we get to the end of this? Or presumably in China there's kind of a bit of rational exuberance on both sides of the equation that as soon as things turn destock turns into restock. Has that historically been the case or should we just think about 2020 starting point as, hey, maybe we will lose some of that destocking headwinds?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, Josh, maybe a couple things. If you look at the channel and I would say the value chains, customer value chains, they react to the dynamics in the end markets pretty quickly. What you saw in the destocking the first half, they were reacting quickly to the build rates and automotive electronics. We expect that to stabilize in the second half. We'll see some additional destocking because of some of the slowing that we saw in second quarter, but it'll stabilize. So really to start to think about what happens in 2020 or even late in the year, it will depend on the end market dynamics. If they recover and their demand goes up, then you would see a pretty strong turnaround in restocking. But if it stabilizes and the projections and outlooks economically are more stable in the second half, then it would be balanced as we get into the second half. And then it depends on what happens in demand as we go into 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Got it. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on business transformation and the savings associated with that. Obviously there's a lot of moving pieces in the organization right now with restructuring, and some of the demand dynamics and the internal destocking. How are you benchmarking on some of the business transformation savings and kind of non-savings related kind of other benefits that would happen throughout the organization? Is that's something where those kind of go by the wayside or harder to execute on? Just an update on how that track. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes we've always talked about transformation as a focus that starts and ends with a customer. But it is really making us more agile, more efficient and more competitive and that that creates value, all of those create value. And it also helped us realign the company around the four businesses, the go-to-market models of customers that we have. So it's enabling us to connect our customers even better as we move ahead. And it's a lot more than an ERP deployment. It's the entire ecosystem around that and it's digitizing our enterprise. All of that's adding efficiency.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And so we are committed to the savings that we talked about at the beginning, it’s the value realization that we would have by the end of 2020. But it does help us drive productivity. It does help us become more efficient broadly. And we talked about how that starts to show up in our margins over time. It's an enabler for us to continue to create premium margins as we move ahead. So it is going to be a driver of the savings that we've talked about, but also of that efficiency that will carry us forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">All right. Thanks guys.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes thanks Josh.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Good morning Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">The $0.07 of the tax benefit, I mean my tax line was relatively in line. Was there then a kind of a higher than expected effective tax rate and does that sustain itself? And also is that a $0.07 benefits kind of now in a run rate per kind of quarter here, or is that just kind of a onetime discreet item?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Steve first of all, it's a – let me just describe it in a little bit of detail. The gas detection business that we own is in a position where we plan to sell it and the tax basis that we're holding that asset at is greater than the plan selling price. But it's also the book value of what we hold with that asset is below the plant's selling price. So when we sell it, we will take an operating income capital gain on that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But from a tax perspective it will be a loss. Now I'm a bit over my skis here describing accounting nuances to you, but the accounting rules are, once you place this asset in a held for sales status if it's in a tax loss position, you take the tax benefit immediately even before the deal actually concentrates. So that $0.07 is a result of us putting it in that status. So that's not an ongoing repeating thing that will be seen.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As far as the underlying operations, no see there's not any big one thing offsetting that. There's always little nips back and forth in the tax rate. And the underlying tax rate for the full year we still think is going to be in the range of 20% to 22%.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. And then gain when it comes to the divestiture, you said, that still $0.20 and that's still to come and not in the guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">It's still not in the guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Pre mature?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes, that's still not in the guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. And then one last one, just on the second half are you planning for kind of there's a lot of things moving around, but are you planning, is this in your mind kind of normal seasonality for you guys for the second half of the year?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Normal seasonality if I look at…</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Normal.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">But the only thing that's abnormal is last year was a bit abnormal for us with some of our pull ahead sales into second quarter. So from a sequential basis we're not seeing this year progressing on an abnormal path. I think it'll be fairly normal.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. And then just one last quick one, this $0.07 it's in the tax line, correct in the models that $0.07?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">That is correct, Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Good morning everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey Deane.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey Deane.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey, the three problem areas that have been pressuring 3M for like more than past year auto electronics in China. So the China you called out has continued to be soft but notionally on a geographic basis is quarter it did not stand out as a particular negative. So can you comment on that and what kind of color you see across your businesses in China, in particular related to kind of the tariff and trade frictions?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes, Dean, we do talk a lot about China auto electronics and kind of get them all together, but maybe just if you step back and look at China for 3M we continue to see strength in our healthcare business up high single digits. And so that was driving a strong growth for us. We also saw strength in our Medical Solutions business in particular. Transportation and Electronics was up low single digits in the quarter. We saw significant decline in Automotive OEM, but that was, countered offset by electronics up low single digits. We saw strong growth in our Transportation Safety business there and our Advanced Materials business. So there was some strength areas that helped trying to balance out.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As I said earlier, sequentially we see Transportation and Electronics a little softer in the second half. And so we're taking a conservative view around build rates in electronics outlook as we built our view of the second half. And that's part of impacting China. But second quarter, some strengths and a good performance against a strong comp year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">That's helpful. And then on electronics, everyone wants to paint electronics all with the same brush, both product lines and geographies. But you made the comment earlier that display film was actually up and relatively strong and it was electronics material solutions that were softer. Maybe just share with us the nuances about why you would see those different dynamics within the supply chain. Maybe there's some semiconductor exposure there as well, but color would be helpful there.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes I think that your last point is the place to start. Our electronic materials solutions business has a broader exposure in electronics, including semiconductor, fabrication, data centers, which continues to be a helpful market and growing. But it's got a little different exposure. Display materials, certainly has the consumer electronics piece. The biggest part of the revenue there is consumer electronics, but we're also moving into higher growth areas like automotive electrification and we continue to see growth there. We continue to see some good results. And I would say consumer electronics, we saw a little bit of an uptick in displayed demand in second quarter, little stronger than maybe we even expected as we started into the quarter. Some of that is you start to see a little bit of buying in anticipation of the second half season for consumer electronics. And so we saw a little bit of that starting in second quarter. And that that hits display materials more so in a much bigger impact than in electronic materials.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">That's helpful. And just last one is more of a comment than a question is I really appreciate the comments about PFAS, and where that stands and the level of transparency that 3M is providing here. I'm just struck by how much misinformation is on the Internet regarding the chemical. Referenced it to being a forever chemical. And the reality is there are a number of very effective ways to remediate the chemical from water. They're all proven to be effective. The question of how much you want to spend, how big is the water body and your timeframe. So the remediation on this looks like it's doable and you all are taking an appreciated approach to this. So just wanted to have that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes thank you Deane. And we understand the concerns people have about their water. We take the issue seriously, but we're also seeing that we can make a difference in remediation and we'll continue to be transparent and update you as we go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Deane Dray</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks everyone. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning John.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning John.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Nick just to clarify. So the $0.20 when you say it's not in the guide, just to be clear, the $9.25, $9.75 would not include the $0.20 of pending gain from the sale of gas and flame. Is that correct?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">John that's correct. It does not include the pending gain from the sale of our gas detection business, nor does it include any impact that will come from Acelity when and if that in and when and if that closes which we expect will be later this year.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Right. And then Nick in the P&amp;L the other expense income line of minus $256 million versus $51 million a year ago, I'm assuming Venezuela charge of $162 million is in that. And is the delta, the $36 million of nonop restructuring kind of getting you to $58 million? And does that number run through – doesn't look like it’s running for the adjusted number, but maybe you can help me with just the bridge there.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, that other, that will include the Venezuela, will also include $36 million from the restructuring actions we took that were not part of operating expense, those were the two biggest things in there.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">There's nothing else in there as consequences. And $36 million does run through, as a cost, runs through the adjusted number, is that correct?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">That is correct. That is correct.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Are there any, just while we're on gas and flame, are there any other businesses, I guess this was part of safety, right? Was there any other businesses Mike or Nick that you're looking at that may be potential candidates for divestiture?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">John, portfolio management is one of our top priorities and as you know it's been ongoing process for us. And we're actively managing this aspect of the portfolio and their fit with our value model. We've shown that when we don't have the right fit, we'll take action. But that's something ongoing process we'll keep you updated.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I guess my question is, would – did this just come about? Or were you've been working on it for a little while, or what was the genesis of it?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">This particular case, the gas detection business, when we made the acquisition of Scott Safety, this was part of our strategy at the time of acquisition. So this was we've talked about on portfolio how we think about complementing our organic priorities with acquisitions that leverage our fundamental strengths. Scott Safety was one of those, moves us into a high value space. And gas detection we identified that early that wasn't part of our strategy and now we're acting on it. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Got It. And then just a couple more cleanups. I think you said – maybe Nick can you just update us on your expectation for share repurchase in the second half? And then I think you raised the dividend by 6% in the first quarter. Maybe Mike, philosophically you've got a lot of – you got a few pressures on your cash call at the moment. Are you committed still to an annual dividend increase kind of looking out?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes John, let me take that. First, as far as the dividend our position for many several years has been that we expected to grow, our dividend to grow in line with earnings over time. Now this particular year is with the 6% increase that's outstripping our earnings growth, but the concept of us continuing to increased earnings our dividends year-over-year, I'd say that's a philosophy and approach we continue to expect. But I would say as far as expecting a dividend increase that over time it will parallel fairly closely our earnings per share growth.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then John remind me of the first part of the question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Sorry share repurchases.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Share repurchase, yes.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I've guided $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year. That would imply at most just a few hundred million in the second half of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And, I'm sorry for this last point. Obviously the earnings are going down, is the philosophy you grow dividends with earnings, but if your earnings are going down, are you just going to hold the dividend, or and then wait for the catch up? Is that kind of the implication? I'm not actually trying to hold you to a number I'm just trying to understand the philosophy.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">No, the philosophy would be over time. I would think unlikely that we would decrease full flat or decrease a dividend even if there was one year of an earnings decline. If I go back to other times in our history where we've had an earnings decline, we still have some small increases in our dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Inch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Walsh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hi, good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning John.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning John.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Walsh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So in the prepared remarks you kind of talked about higher pricing being able to offset inflation for the full year. Just want to pull apart that price piece and just we've seen a deceleration right for the full year on an absolute basis.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, I'll go even further John. So we've averaged about 70 basis points of price growth in the first half of the year. My best estimate for the full year is we'll be right in that range. So I wouldn't characterize it as a deceleration. I think about 70 basis points first half. I think something in the range of 70 basis points that can have is our best view on that now. And remain quite confident that it will more than outpace what we're seeing from a raw material and tariff inflation impact.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Walsh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Got you. And then just thinking about the third quarter organic growth the flat to up low single digits that still implies that the growth on growth would decelerate because you have an easier comp in Q3 of 2018, just maybe some color that you saw exiting the quarter, June, July, anything you can kind of talk to as the trajectory seeing currently.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">John's the biggest trajectory change that I'll say that that colors the flat to up low-single digits in the third quarter as far as versus a comp is my earlier statement that we expect Transportation and Electronics to be down low to mid-single digit. I think that will be the thing that colors why sequentially versus an easier comp it's not quite the same level of growth you would expect. When I look across the rest of our businesses your analysis you just went through, I think, is a pretty valid analysis.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">John Walsh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Great, appreciate it. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes thanks John.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Laurence Alexander</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning. I have two quick ones. Can you just give a little bit more detail on what trends you're seeing in aerospace, it seemed a bit weaker than what we've heard from other companies.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And secondly, on PFAS or PFOS and PFOA, that litigation area, can you characterize whether the U.S. standards are tougher or easier than in Europe? And maybe just sort of help us get in front, get ahead of where the food contactor base is because I think that that's like another cloud of noise that shouldn't really be affecting you. But I think sort of people are, sort of focused on the European side there?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes, Lawrence maybe starting with aerospace when we talked about the business we talked about Automotive and Aerospace together as one business and when you look at the divisions that we share and that we report the revenue from its together. Our aerospace business actually has shown some good growth as we come through the first half of the year. So it's smaller than our automotive business, but it's an important business for us in doing well. So I don't think we're saying anything different, in that respect. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">What I would say about, thinking about Europe versus U.S. and PFAS or PFOA, PFOS regulations, the regulations are really evolving right now. I don't think it's clear to – I don't think I can clearly compare U.S. versus other international Europe regulations it’s very evolving and we're working with regulators broadly both federal and local.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Laurence Alexander</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. Good morning fellows.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hi, Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hi, Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hey obviously a lot of ground covered. I thought it might be interesting to just flip the script a little bit to things that look okay or a little bit better. So in particular your confidence level and consumer maybe being kind of middle of the guy, healthcare may be better. Just a couple finer points on what you see going on there what would drive that? Where are we at in kind of the drug delivery, comps, et cetera?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes, so I would say if you look at healthcare, we talked about at a good quarter. And behind that is a strong market growth. So this was a – we’re not a place where we got good market dynamics and our businesses are performing well. We had our biggest business, our Medical Solutions business, up mid single digits, we saw strength in the U.S. we saw strength in China as I talk about it.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Our food safety business was up mid-single digits, our Health Information Systems business was up high single digits. So it's pretty broad-based performance as we went through the quarter. We did see a decline in drug delivery as we expected in mid-sing digits in Q2. We’re talking about how we see that stabilizing as we go through 2019 and we do see some improvements sequentially as we go into the second half in that business. So that will actually help the overall performance of the Health Care business. So second half we also have the same comparables year-over-year dynamic. We have a little easier comparable in the second half. So strong market dynamics, a portfolio performing well, broadly and I think, a strong of performance against comps in the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">You look at Consumer we're at 1% and as Nick's comments said, kind of the middle of the range as we look for the total year. If we look, we got good balance between our sell in and sell out. And all of our businesses in the second quarter were growing with exception of our home care business. And we see that sell out dynamic setting up a good middle of the range kind of performance in the second half against some growth in retail spending in the macro.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Is there anything that conclude or any comp issue as it relates to that home care business? What was actually going on there?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I think we saw maybe a little bit of a comp year-over-year we had some of the same go-live of the U.S. ERP deployment impacting that business. And I would say consumer is larger in the U.S. than some of our other businesses. About half of our global revenue is in the U.S. So it's a bigger footprint. So it has a slightly higher impact when you have that pull ahead, and it did impact all of those businesses in 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Alright, thank you guys.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nick Gangestad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yes thanks Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Roman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thanks Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">That concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Mike Roman</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">To wrap up, I am encouraged by our Company's progress in the second quarter. Our execution was strong in the face of continued slow growth conditions and key end markets. As we effectively managed costs and improved our cash flow. Moving ahead and we remain focused on continuing to drive operational improvements, investing for the future and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Rosie Perez</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Appreciate all of you joining us for today’s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company’s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today’s presentation slides and in the company’s reports on file with the SEC.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings material for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Today’s discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company’s progress and results, and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remark, we’ll move to a Q&amp;A session on the financial results, with both Steve and Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With that, let me turn it over to Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Stephen Squeri</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Rosie. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. As our second quarter results showed, we continue to build on the broad based momentum we entered the year with.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">FX adjusted revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 10% and earnings per share of $2.07 was 13% higher than last year. I feel good about these results, as well as the breadth and consistency of our performance. This is the eighth straight quarter we posted FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% [ph] or better. And our growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of spending, fees and loans spread across geographies and customer segments.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We continue to see solid trends in Card Member spending led by consumers. This spending is occurring as the backdrop of an economy that is growing at a steady, with more modest pace relative to 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">FX adjusted proprietary billings grew 8% on a consolidated basis and loan growth remained strong with over 60% of that growth coming from existing customers. Credit continued to perform at industry leading levels, driven by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk management capabilities and the opportunity we have to increase our share of our customers lending wallets.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">The consistent growth we're seeing speaks to the strength of our differentiated business model and the success of our focus on our four strategic imperatives. It’s been a busy first half of the year and I thought it would be good to take a step back and reflect on some of the progress we’re making in each of our priority areas.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the Consumer space, we’re continuing our disciplined approach globally to upgrade our premium card products, enhancing our unique value propositions and pricing for the additional value that we’re delivering to our card members.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the second quarter, we launched new and refreshed Platinum Cards in the UK, Italy, Finland, Norway and Sweden. And in early July, we launched an enhanced Platinum Card in Germany.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also made several additional enhancements to the Gold Card in the US and earlier in the year, we launched the new suite of co-branded Marriott Bonvoy cards. In each case, we’re leveraging our differentiated business model to offer unique benefits, services and experiences to our card members in categories of travel, dining, and access to popular events and experiences.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">These are some of the aspects of our products that are more difficult for others to replicate, and they are the ones that our card members most value and are willing to pay for.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In fact, nearly 70% of the new consumer cards we acquired this quarter carry an annual fee, and card fee revenue grew 17% year-over-year and accelerated sequentially quarter-over-quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In addition, we’re seeing strong results in attracting next-generation consumers to the franchise, with our most recent US consumer product refreshes more than 50% of our new card members are millennials or Gen Zers. I believe we have a long runway to continue this growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Commercial Payments, scaling our B2B payment offerings is one of our key growth strategies. Expanding our network of strategic partnerships is a key enabler here and we’re making great progress.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our commercial customers increasingly want payments integrated into their Procure to Pay infrastructure, and we’re developing a range of solutions, which do that for businesses of all sizes and complexities.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">For example, we’re partnering with providers like Amazon Business, Tradeshift, and most recently SAP Ariba to help large and global companies track and reconcile payments within their ERP systems.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">For our larger SME customers who are looking for ways to increase efficiency and cash flow. We're working with companies like Wax and MineralTree on payment solutions by integrating their accounting and procurement systems. And for our small business customers, who are offering an AP Automation solution with Bill.com that makes it easier for them to pay their suppliers using our cards.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our objective is to provide payment capabilities and financing solutions that help our customers manage and grow their business. We want them to view American Express as an essential partner, whether they’re single proprietorship or a Fortune 500 company.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're still in a relatively early stage of this journey, but we’re making good progress in building out our B2B offerings, and we’ll continue to invest in this area going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Moving on to our third imperative of strengthening our global integrated network. We’re on track to achieve our goal of virtual parity coverage in the US by year end. We’re also making good progress on expanding merchant coverage internationally and building our network in China.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the second quarter, we announced that card members can now tap and pay with their contactless-enabled American Express Cards or digital wallets for subway and bus rides in New York City, as part of the MTA's new pilot program.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">This is just another example of the vast array of opportunities in the payment space, as contactless will convert more cash transactions to mobile and plastic. Once consumers have experienced the speed, convenience and security of contactless payments in public transit, they are more likely to tap and pay at other establishments, such as quick service restaurants, retailers and more.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We’ll continue to expand our contactless capabilities in the US and internationally both through third party mobile providers and through the issuance of contactless enabled cards. We're also working with merchants to expand contactless acceptance in order to give our card members more options for easy and efficient ways to pay.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our fourth imperative, making American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives, cuts across all of our lines of business. We know that our card members spend much of their time online, particularly on their mobile devices. We want to help them manage more aspects of their lives by integrating more content, capabilities, experiences and benefits into all of the ways we interact digitally with them.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We’re making good progress on this front, and to accelerate our efforts we’ve acquired a number of digital companies over the past 18 months including Mezi, LoungeBuddy, Cake Technologies, Pocket Concierge and our newest acquisition Resy, the US restaurant booking and management platform, which we announced in May.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">These acquisitions along with new digital features and contents we’re continually building in-house, will enable our card members to do more with their American Express membership directly from their mobile device, whether it’s getting a recommendation for a new restaurant, finding tickets to popular events, reserving a spot at the nearest airport lounge, redeeming rewards points for a wide variety of merchandise and experiences, saving money at some of their favorite merchants or booking travel.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Today our card members are engaging with our app more frequently and on a wider range of activities in addition to performing traditional transactions by checking their spending and paying their bills. We expect this to increase as we work to integrate more new capabilities and benefits.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In summary, I feel good about the quarter and I like where we stand at the halfway point of the year. Our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance and leveraging the power of our differentiated business model is paying off across the enterprise. This strategy is driving growth in spending, lending, customer acquisitions and engagement across businesses and geographies.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our results give us confidence that we’re on the right track to delivering on our goal of consistent revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we’re reaffirming our guidance for the full year of delivering revenue in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted earnings per share of between $7.85 and $8.35.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now, I’d like to turn it over to Jeff with detailed discussion about our second quarter results and then we’ll be happy to take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Jeffrey Campbell</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Well, thanks Steve. And good morning, everyone. And yes we are having our call in the morning instead of our historical evening timeslot after trying it in the morning last quarter due to the holiday calendar, we felt the timing worked a bit better for us from a process standpoint, and from feedback from many of you, it sounds like many of you prefer a morning call as well.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">With that, it’s good to be here today. Let’s talk about another solid quarter in 2019 and about another quarterly example of the consistent performance we have been delivering for some time now.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let’s get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Second quarter revenues of $10.8 billion grew 10% on an FX adjusted basis. As Steve mentioned, I think it bears repeating this is the eighth straight quarter of having FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better. And importantly for the future, this growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of growth and spend lend and fee revenues, across geographies and across customer segments.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">I would point out that we continue to see a stronger US dollar relative to last year against most of the major currencies in which we operate. So you again see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and our FX adjusted revenue growth of 10%.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies in which we operate began in the third quarter of last year. So assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the second half of 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our strong topline performance drove net income of $1.8 million, up 9% from a year ago and then aided by our assumption of a more typical level of share repurchases over the last four quarters, our EPS was $2.07, representing double-digit EPS growth of 13% in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking now at the details of our performance, I’ll start with billed business, which you’ve seen several views of on Slides 4 through 6.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Starting on Slide 4, our FX adjusted total billings growth for the second quarter was 7% in line with Q1. As we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes, we think it's important to continue to break out our billings growth trends between our proprietary and network businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our proprietary business which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was up 8% in the second quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which come from our network business, GNS, was down 2% in the quarter and an FX adjusted basis. This is less of a decline than prior quarters as we are getting closer to lapping the impact of exiting our network partnerships in the European Union and Australia.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to Slide 5, you will recall that during our last earnings call in April, we saw the full impact of lapping a step up in the growth in spending from our existing customers that began in the late Q4 of 2017 and became even more evident in Q1 of 2018. We attributed that acceleration which occurred across geographies and customer segments to an increase in confidence in our customer base.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">To bring this comment up to date, our Q2 2019 results show a continuation of the Q1 2019 trends, solid and steady growth though at a more modest pace relative to 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">If you then turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer-type for the second quarter, starting on the left with a large and global commercial customers, we saw a 5% growth on an FX adjusted basis for the second quarter, in line with Q1 and our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs in the US grew 7% in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We feel good about our continued leadership position with both of these customer types. I would suggest that the growth levels here are reflective of the economic tones Steve discussed, stable and growing, though at more modest levels than the very robust growth we saw in 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">But also note that we will continue to watch these two commercial customer types closely to determine whether we are seeing perhaps a bit of caution in our commercial spending trends which we are not seeing in the consumer segment at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">International SME, however, remains our highest growth customer type with 17% FX adjusted growth in the second quarter. During Investor Day, we highlighted the long-term growth opportunity in this segment, given the low penetration we have in the top countries where we operate international small business products and we continue to believe we have a long runway for higher levels of growth in this segment.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving to US consumer which made up of 32% of the company’s billings in the second quarter, billings were up 8%, reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers, and in general, solid growth on the part of consumers.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the teens at 15% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key countries with double-digit growth in Mexico and Australia and growth of 20% and 18% for the UK and Japan, respectively.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 6% on an FX adjusted basis.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. We continued, as we have for years now, to grow a little faster than the industry by taking advantage of the unique opportunity that our historical under penetration of our own customer’s card-based borrowing behaviors creates.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Total loan growth was 11% in the second quarter, with over 60% of that growth coming from our existing customers. And on the right hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.8%, up 20 basis points relative to the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">While we’ve been saying for some time that these yield increases were going to moderate, we are pleased that our yield is still increasing year-over-year from continued impacts from mix and pricing for risk.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Slide 8 then shows you the credit implications of our strategy. On the left you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.3% in the second quarter, up 20 basis points from the prior year and in line with the first quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the right, you can see that the charged write-off rate, excluding GCP was 1.7%, down 10 basis points for the prior year, as well as the prior quarter. You’ll also see the delinquency and GCP net loss ratio trends. All of these lead to the same conclusion we have reached in recent quarters.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We still do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing better than we expected so far this year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">So given these credit metric and loan volume trends, you can see on Slide 9 the provision expense was $861 million in the second quarter, up just 7%, while loans, as I said earlier, were up 11%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As you think about this relationship, I would remind you that we have talked in a few forums [ph] about how we have been evolving over the past year a number of the things we’re doing on the risk management side, to create a greater margin of safety and position us well for any potential future downturn. These changes, coupled with the stable economic environment and the fact that we are acquiring a higher percentage of new accounts on premium fee-based products, are driving our provision cost to be below our original expectations.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As you think about the full year, during our first quarter earnings call we said we expected provision growth in the mid-20% range in 2019. Given the positive underlying trends we have seen in the first half of the year, I would now expect to do better than this, with provision growth below 20% for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">While we’re on the subject of provision, let me take a few minutes to step away from our results and talk about CECL. We've made good progress on our implementation efforts, though there is a lot of work left before implementation on January 1 of next year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL this quarter, our current total reserves of $2.9 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve, due to the extremely short life of charge receivable.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">To be clear, the ultimate impact will depend on the loan and receivable portfolio compositions, macroeconomic conditions and forecast of the adoption date, as well as other factors including the remaining management judgments as we finish off our modeling.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I would leave you on CECL though with three important takeaways. First, remember that CECL represents an accounting driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk portfolio or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Second for us given our strong balance sheet, 30% plus return on equity and spend-centric model, the capital impact of the one-time implementation increase in reserves will likely very be manageable.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Third, while the impact of implementation is getting the majority of the attention to date, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. The ultimate impact will of course be heavily [Technical Difficulty]</p>, <p class=""p p6"">However, the growth in our lending portfolio, which has been higher than the industry, coupled with the increased reserve requirement for loans, will very likely result in incremental provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So now let’s get back to our results. In terms of the strong revenue growth of 10% on an FX adjusted basis that you see on Slide 10, we see our eighth straight quarters of FX adjusted revenue growth being at least 8%, as evidence that our focus on investing in share scale and relevance is working.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And this growth is driven by broad-based growth across spend lend and fee revenues as you can see on Slide 11. Importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained at roughly 80% in the second quarter, in line with the recent history. Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX adjusted basis, which I’ll come back to on the next slide.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Net card fees growth accelerated to 17% in the second quarter. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment, our unique value propositions, and our focus on fee-based products that Steve talked about in his opening remarks. And we feel good about our ability to maintain this strong growth in net card fees given the breadth of products that are driving our momentum. Net interest income grew at 13% in the second quarter driven by growth in loans and net yield.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now I know that many of you are focused on the outlook for interest rates, and what that means for various financial companies, given that the latest rate projections are a bit lower than they were at the beginning of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">I would remind you that for us, the impact of modest changes in rates is fairly muted. Our sizable charge portfolio does mean that our balance sheet is a bit liability sensitive, but we manage our funding stack to keep that sensitivity in a range.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">If you look at our latest 10-Q - excuse me, 10-K disclosures, it implies that a 25 basis point increase in rates would cost us about $0.01 of EPS a quarter on a run rate basis over the ensuing year. All else equal, including a beta on our deposit account in line with recent history, the impact of a 25 basis point decrease would be similar in size.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Keep in mind as well of course, that today’s modestly lower rate outlook is caused by a view that the economy is a bit weaker, which would tend to move our overall results in the opposite direction of the rate impact itself. Putting this all together, I don’t expect current changes in interest rate expectations to have a material impact on our 2019 results.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. On the right you see that discount revenue grew in line with billings in the second quarter at 7% on an FX adjusted basis, making this the seventh consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued strong evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue not the average discount rate is working.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Moving on now to the things we are doing to drive our strong revenue growth, let’s start with our customer engagement cost, which you can see on Slide 13 were $5 billion in the second quarter, up 11% versus last year, a bit more than revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning at the bottom with marketing and business development, I’d remind you that this line has two components, our traditional marketing and promotional expenses, as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Marketing and business development costs were up 7% in Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">There are two offsetting impacts to mention on this slide. First, our marketing spending will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters in 2019, driving lower growth in marketing and business development in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, as we grow over the launch of our global brand campaign in the second quarter of last year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Offsetting this impact this quarter is the expected $200 million increase in 29 [ph] marketing and business development, driven by the extension we signed in Q1 of our enterprise-wide Delta partnership. This impact will be spread across three quarters beginning with our second quarter results.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Moving onto rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth. Continuing on to Card Member services, as you have seen for sometime and as we continue to expect Card Member services costs were our fastest growing expense line up 35% in the second quarter, as this line includes many components of our differentiated value propositions, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based product. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the level of customer engagement we see with our premium benefits and services.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">That then brings us to the operating expense line on Slide 14, which was up 7% in the quarter. While there is always some variability in OpEx quarter-to-quarter, I would say that some of the drivers of our strong revenue performance, growth in sales force, premium servicing and digital capabilities will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">That said, we have a long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues, and we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning to capital. On Slide 15 our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11% at the top end of our 10% to 11% of target range and we returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As you know in previous years, we’ve issued a press release at the end of the CCAR process announcing our capital plan. Since we were not subject to the CCAR process this year we chose not to issue a press release in June.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As we’ve said, the reality is going forward our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 capital ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now we’ve historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength, while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders, and you should expect us to continue that philosophy. In terms of what this means going forward, I’d reiterate the same philosophy we have talked about all this year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">First, remember that our industry leading ROE, which was 32% this quarter, means we generate a tremendous amount of capital each year. In deploying this capital our philosophy is straightforward. You can expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings as it has historically.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Consistent with this, you may have noticed in our press release today that we intend to increase our dividend from $0.39 to $0.43 subject to board approval, beginning with the declaration in Q3, ‘19 and payable in Q4, ‘19.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We’ll then use a modest portion of our capital generated to continue to support our organic growth and if you look at the last 18 months, the occasional small acquisition. And we will return the remainder of our capital to our shareholders, while managing within the 10% to 11% CET1 target range.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">To sum up before we open the call for your questions, our solid performance in the first half of the year reflects our investment strategy focused on share scale and relevance, delivering high levels of revenue growth and steady and consistent EPS growth.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">For the full year 2019, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and having our adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.85 and $8.35.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">During our earnings call in January and Investor Day in March, we said that the lower end of the EPS range is there, if there is some more significant economic slowdown relative to 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Halfway through 2019 we continue to see a stable and growing economy, though not quite at the robust levels of growth we saw in 2018 as we put our 2019 plan together. In addition we've had a few changes relative to our regional outlook for the year. Most significantly, we have a $200 million increase to marketing and business development from the Delta renewal, which you saw beginning in our results for the second quarter and going in the other direction, we have more favorable credit performance relative to our initial expectation. Given where we are today, I would expect our full year EPS results to be more in line with the middle part of our original guidance range.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Rosie.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Rosie Perez</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&amp;A, I’ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?</p>, <p class=""p p8"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Sanjay Sakhrani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I’ll start off with where you ended Jeff on the guidance. You mentioned the middle part of the range and thinking through the $200 million and the favorable provision, it would seem to me like the provision given the credit trajectory has been trending better roughly in the $200 million. Perhaps you can just reconcile that for me?</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then as far as the CECL numbers you gave in terms of the quantification, I was just doing the back of the envelope on the percentage you mentioned. And if we were to assume a sort of similar environment to this year, it would seem like the provision might go up low single digits percentage wise. I know there is a lot of assumptions. Can you just help us think through that? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">So two good questions Sanjay. Thank you for them. First, on the guidance. I’d really say there is three things going on all of which I talked about in my remarks. You’re correct, U.K. added $200 million of costs this year due to the tremendous new long-term agreement we have with Delta. It’s a great thing for shareholders long-term. Offsetting that provision is clearly much better than we had expected. And I’d say you're right that benefit is probably a little bit bigger than the $200 million.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But I think the third thing to recall is if you go back Sanjay to the January call when we first talked about guidance, I said at the time that in the world where 2019 turns out to look kind of like 2018 in terms of the economy, you should expect us to be in the middle or upper part of the range.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">You know, in fact, while the economy is stable, it is clearly growing at a more modest level than it was in 2019 - 2018 when we put our plan together based on the more robust growth you saw in 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, it's a little bit of softness in volume relative to our expectation. And so that’s really the missing third piece. All that said, eight straight quarters of revenue growth above 8%, 10% revenue growth this quarter we feel tremendous about the momentum.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">On the CECL side, boy, predicting the ongoing P&amp;L impact of CECL Sanjay has so many moving parts right now, I am reluctant to give you a number. All I was trying to do on the call at this point is begin to focus people a little bit on the fact that for us the one time increase in reserves given the strength of our balance sheet and ROE, it doesn’t have any material impact I think in our capital returns.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">But the ongoing provision costs depending on the environment is something that you will probably hear us continue to talk about and I think your back of the envelope is as good as any. I just cautioned that there could be lots of different factors that affect it going forward. So thanks for the question Sanjay.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And for our next question we’ll go to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Don Fandetti</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, good morning. Jeff I think most financial institutions have put out a buyback discussion. I know you provided some general background. Is there any reason why you're not talking specifically about that?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then secondarily, what is your general thought on operating leverage or lack thereof? Obviously, your OpEx expense is growing at a more rapid pace. But if you sort of layer in engagement cost, are your expenses going to grow faster than your revenues?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. So, two things. First, on capital, Don, we said for a while now that the governor of how we manage our share repurchase is that we intend to keep that CET1 ratio in the 10% to 11% range and that is actually more important than where we are with the Fed.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And so depending on our earnings, depending on our levels of organic growth, that’s how you should expect us to move the share repurchase up and down. Now, all that said, that means share repurchase have leveled very similar to what you’ve seen since we’ve rebuilt the balance sheet post the Tax Act charge.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">But that’s really the way I encourage everyone to think about our capital return not – that we are no longer in this world where the CCAR outcomes are governing what we’re doing on capital and so we’re going to return exactly that amount of capital.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">On leverage, boy, I think we’re just executing Don on the financial and business model that we’ve been talking about ever since Steve became CEO last February, which is, we’re generating industry’s leading levels of revenue growth. We think that’s the best way to create value for our shareholders long term.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Customer engagement cost has been and, I expect, will continue to grow a little faster than our revenues and so that creates a little bit of margin compression. That’s mitigated by the fact that we expect operating expenses to grow less than revenue, they have for a decade, we’re highly confident that they will continue to. And then you add a little bit of share repurchase to all that and you get a double-digit EPS growth.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now, that does mean that PTI, in any given period may grow a little faster or a little slower than revenue. But we think this is the right strategy, focused on share, scale and relevance for creating the most value for our shareholders in the long term.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">For our next question, we’ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mark DeVries</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. Thank you. It seemed like the US consumer might have been the biggest source of strength in the quarter. I think you guys – you had proprietary billables and it's actually declined modestly Q-over-Q, but your discount revenue growth accelerated. Was that due to the acceleration in the US consumer where presumably you have higher discount rate revenue?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then also, just higher level, what are you seeing from the US consumer? Are they being more resilient for some of the uncertainties we’re seeing around things like the China trade issues that they may be having maybe a bigger impact on the corporate side?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, maybe I’ll start Mark on the math and, Steve, you might add a little bit of color. Look, I think, when you look sequentially, sure as you’ve heard from many people, the consumer is strong and you did see in the US Consumer business a little bit of a modest uptick in billings sequentially.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">You know, all that said, I think, we see overall stability, but at more modest levels than last year. Commercial spending is still at a good level, but I exercise - I noted a little bit of caution. We just have our eye on that a little bit more than the consumer. So I don’t know, Steve, maybe you want to add a little bit of color.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. I mean, look, I think that international is still strong as well. I mean, you had 17% international SME growth, you have 15% international consumer growth. But just a comment in US SME. I think when we dig into the numbers in US SME, what I always look at is, how are we bringing on new booked business. So that’s from new signings and that’s been stable for a long time. How are we looking at the attrition and that’s also been very stable.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">What you see and I think this is to Jeff's point, what you see is maybe a little less confidence that the consumer from an SME perspective where there is been organic decline from what we would say, pretty much all time highs from what we’re growing over, but it’s still positive. So that's US SME.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And I think large corporate, you know, we’re pretty comfortable with large corporate, especially when we had such a breakout year, I think, last year from large and global corporate accounts.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So I think the commercial side of the business is being slightly more cautious than the consumer side. And I think you’ve heard that as you listen to other earnings calls this week as well. So - but still strong, I mean, still strong growth. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And our next question will be from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just to pick up on those comments with international SME. I know it’s been on a little bit of a decelerating trend here 17% is still a very strong number, but it was - I believe 25% is recently the year ago. So you’ve got some tough comps you’re working through.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I guess as those - trying to get easier for the next few quarters is it essentially and obviously you see some reacceleration in international SME? And then if you can just separately make a quick comment on the sustainability of the card fee growth which continues to be very impressive that would be great? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. So I think I got the question with a little bit of the background noise. But look, I mean, if you look at what was going on for international SME for pretty much like six quarters prior to this, you had sort of the long run of 20% growth, but often relatively smaller base.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I am pretty happy where we are with 17% international SME growth. We continue to invest not only in the value propositions, but in the sales organizations, and our absolute numbers are actually getting bigger and bigger. So I am not really worried at all about 17% international SME growth. Our performance there has been, I think really outstanding.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So we’re going to - and we're going to continue to invest. I mean, that’s one of the reasons why you saw a little bit of an uptick sort of an operating expenses is we’re investing in sales organizations not only international SME, but we’re investing in some sales resources as well as it relates to - international coverage. So you have some extra OpEx as it relates to that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As far as card – as far as card fees go, you know, card fees is all about adding value to the products and we will continue on our quest to continue to add differentiated value on an ongoing basis to all of our products around the globe. We have taken a very deliberate step to make sure that we are constantly looking at and refreshing these products on a very proactive basis.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And by doing that, that enables us to continue to add tremendous pace that we’ve been on in terms of card fee acceleration. I mean, you saw 17% card fee growth year-over-year, and you even saw a sequential uptick, and 70% of the cards that we acquired, our fee-based cards and people are paying for those cards because they are getting value out of those cards.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And so it is how our model has been for decades, and we will continue to invest in those value propositions so that we can continue to generate card fees.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">We’ll go next to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">James Friedman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie. Steve, I wanted to ask you about the M&amp;A strategy. You had some activity year-to-date. How would you describe the themes in M&amp;A, because some of it seems consumer oriented, but some of it seems merchant oriented like your last couple – if you could provide some instruction about how you’re thinking about M&amp;A would be helpful?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. So, look for every business, we have an opportunity to grow sort of three different ways, right? You grow from organic growth, you grow through partnerships, and you grow through acquisitions.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">I think, if you look at the last sort of five acquisitions or so, and I think you picked up on a really important point with Resy but I'll get to that in a minute. But if you really look at the last five acquisitions, while you can say they are consumer rated, consumer driven what they really are is all about embedding ourselves more in our customers digital lives. And those customers are not only consumers, but they are small business, and they're corporate card customers.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So maybe for a business process perspective, we’re not - we haven't done any M&amp;A in that area. But when you think about what we've done, it first started out, and we started with some building blocks. We started out with Mezi which is digital based AI assist and now we’ve roll that out in the UK and we’re testing that in the US with some of our platinum cardholders.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then we went with Cake, which is really sort of middleware to help us sort of manage our restaurant reservation. We went with Pocket Concierge, which Japan is a really important market for us and that gave us access to some of the best restaurants in Japan.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then we went with LoungeBuddy because our focus has been on providing a great experience end-to-end for the travelers. And while I'm not going to be able to build hundreds of lounges, we’ve got 12 right now and will continue to add them selectively as we go along. LoungeBuddy from a mobile perspective will show our customers exactly where other lounges are and we get access to lots of the lounges.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then the last one Resy, which is really sort of two-pronged and I think we probably not done a good enough job talking about the merchant side of this. But it will give us access to some of the what we believe is some of the finest restaurants and actually one of the more requested restaurants from our card members and be able to not only provide special Card Member offers, but to also be able to acquire new card members when they actually use the Resy app and seeing what our existing card members were getting.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And for restaurants, the thing that we love Resy is they look at the fact that they have two customers. They have the card, they have the diner as a customer, and they have the restaurant and the customers, and restaurants are really important partners for us.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And so what you’re seeing is a concept - a continue to build out whether it be organically partnership or via acquisition. And remember we had a partnership with LoungeBuddy before this to constantly and consistently move more upstream or in-stream into our customers digital lives.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So we’ll be opportunistic. We’ll continue to look for those companies either from a partnership perspective or an acquisition perspective that will continue to build-out our digital capabilities.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And we’ll continue to look on the commercial side, but I don't want you to think its all consumer, because small businesses can use this and our corporate card customers can use this as well.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">We’ll go now to the line up David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">David Togut</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. And good morning. You’ve been repositioning American Express in Europe over the last year principally winding down GNS. With the next wave of payment regulation coming PSD2 on September 14th along with strong customer authentication requirements, is there more to do, you signaled on the last call you might introduce a debit card for example. I'd be curious for your updated thoughts?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">No. I don't know that we - yeah, well actually yes. Not necessarily a debit card, but access for sort of more real-time payments, but - with PSIP. But I think that we’ll wind down Europe by the end of this year, and so you won't have that grow over.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our value propositions are very strong in Europe. We still - the reason we - just to refresh everybody’s memory, the reason we wound this done is, we wanted to stay as a three party scheme versus a four party scheme, which aspects of our business in Europe were four-party, which enables us to have a better, not only better value proposition, but in fact a higher discount rate as it relates to our transactions there.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But I don’t see us introducing a debit card per se, and I think we’ll just continue on our path of increasing our value to our customers both from small business perspective and from a consumer perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And the only thing I’d add, David on your specific question around September 14th deadline on merchants having better than authentication capabilities, we’re working with our merchants. It’s not a big cost for us. It’s really a merchant question. We don’t expect it to cause any significant inflection point. There is some talk about banks deferring a little bit because not all merchants were ready to launch. But I don’t see it as a big issue.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">No actually and we’ll leverage our safety technology to do that. But in fact it's really more about conversations and visits with merchants more than just technology and we’ve been really ahead of the curve on that in educating merchants on how to interact. So not a cost issue for us at all.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And we’ll go now to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Moshe Orenbuch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great, thanks. You started to kind of discuss some of the aspects of this. But could you talk a little bit about the - how would you expect the SME business to perform both in terms of kind of growth rate and in terms of credit as the economy looks to be a little more variable? Is it more or less kind of volatile than the consumer side?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Well, we feel really good about the breadth of our small business franchise. As you know Moshe we talk a lot about the fact that we are in the US larger than our next five competitors combined outside the US where we have some of the highest growth rates in the company. Our shares tend to be small and we think we have a very long run way to continue to grow.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We are broadly speaking and I am actually going to take your question beyond just small business, one of the things you've heard me talk about in my prepared remarks is we actually have been making some changes in all of our risk management practices steadily across the last year. That’s both a consumer and a small business issue because they are both so important to us.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And in fact those changes are part along with a stable economic environment of what’s driving stronger than expected credit performance for us provision actually being up less than loan.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So all of those things we think help prepare us to continue to perform strongly in all economic environments. We always spend a lot of time thinking about how we manage the company through all aspects of an economic cycle. We make every economic decision around customers assuming through the cycle view of the economics. So we feel good about where we are in our preparation.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah. The other point that I would make is when you look at international SME, it’s predominantly if not 100% a charged business for us, and which has a lot less - obviously, a lot less volatility. And our small business portfolio is more heavily charge based than our - in fact our consumer portfolio as well.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">We’ll go next to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning, Bill.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Bill Carcache</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks. Jeff, I wanted to follow up on some of your comments regarding the rate environment. I understand your point that there is a natural buffer in your business model based on the interplay between a stronger or weaker economy and higher or lower rates.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">But to the extent that the Fed is turning more accommodative in an effort to extend the cycle and not because economic conditions are deteriorating then wouldn’t that be a scenario where lower rates would benefit you?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Steve if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on the digital investments that you guys are making, specifically on cloud you’ve guys have talked about pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy versus a public cloud strategy that some of your competitors are pursuing. Is there any concern that you may be falling behind your competitors relative to the investments that they are making? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, let me - I'll answer the second one. No, I think look having been CIO of this company and spent 10 years running technology, I am really comfortable with where we are. From an economic perspective, the reason we have a hybrid strategy is we believe that on an ongoing basis, we have better economics by running our own private clouds. Now that may not be the case with everybody else. But when you go to one of the cloud providers, you have a situation where there is obviously just profit built in.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So as we focused on our infrastructure and if you look at our technology cost over a long period of time, our run the - our run the company cost are best in class and they have been decreasing over time. So I am really comfortable with where we are from a hybrid strategy perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And what you do is you look to put workloads out there that are variable in nature. And so I think having a hybrid strategy really works well for us because it enables us not to have some of the fixed cost investment that you would just need to have on a variable basis.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, I don’t see we’re falling behind at all, and I think we might have been a little bit ahead with the hybrid strategy that we have deployed.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Bill on rates. Look I’d just started by reminding everyone that 80% of our revenues come from spend and fee revenues. So just the math starts with the fact that relative to any other financial institution, we’re just far less sensitive in terms of our overall economics to where our rates are going.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Second, we do manage our funding stack in terms of our fixed floating mix to keep our exposure to changes in rates pretty modest and that’s why in my prepared remarks I pointed out that when you think about a 25 basis point change, it’s $0.01 a quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then assuming quarters third, there is this economic offset, right? I think in response to Sanjay’s first question, I did point out that the economy is growing slowly than it was last year as the rate environment or the rate outlook has come down a little bit, that’s because people are worried about the economy. That provides a little bit of a natural offset to even a modest impact that rates do.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, look, we pay attention to rates. I am just making a general point that when you net it all out for us, I don’t see modest changes in the rate environment up and down as something that’s going to move the needle in our overall earnings. I think operator let’s keep going and probably squeeze in one or two more here.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">We’ll go next to the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">John Hecht</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Your discount rate has been very stable year-over-year and I know you’ve taken specific guidance regarding the discount rate off the table.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">But I am wondering if you can tell us is there any trends whether you’re looking by channel, by region, by product or mix shift? Is there any trends underlying that we should think about for the next couple of quarters?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jeffrey Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Well, I just remind you, yes, you are correct, we’re focused on driving discount revenue which we feel great about not average discount rate. All of that said, we’re also getting further from some of the things we’ve talked about for a few years, the impact of regulation in Australia and the European Union. The impact about Blue, some big strategic deals we cut. And so those are having an impact on the average discount rate.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">But the thing that I just want to emphasize is, we feel good about the discount revenue trajectory. That's what we’re focused on driving and the rate will average - discount rate will kind of go where it will. Operator?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">We’ll go next to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Maurer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the Blue Business Cash Card that you put a release out on yesterday. You talked about the invoicing product and that you were launching effectively what seems like a working capital program that will be paid over ACH. Curious is that a new offering? How are you marketing it, how big is it today if it's not a new offering? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">So actually the working capital product's been out there for a couple of years now, which - maybe you got sort of mixed up in this - in the Blue Cash announcement. But the working capital product has been out there for quite a long time, a couple of years. It is relatively small and it does ride over ACH rails.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And what we want do is remember, what we wanted to do with small businesses is to help run their businesses and part - the role that the card plays is part of their overall working capital solution. And so there are suppliers and there are merchants that do not accept credit card payments of any type, not just American Express with Visa and MasterCard.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And so to be able to provide, along with providing the card product, to be able to provide a working capital product as well to these customers, helps them manage their business and helps them manage their cash flow. And the reality is these are loans that are anywhere from 30 to 90 days.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Maurer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">How big is it?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Squeri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">It's very tiny.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Rosie Perez</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. With that, we’ll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you again for joining today’s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for digitized replay beginning at 10:30 AM Eastern Time today and running until July 26 at Midnight Eastern Time.

Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services, where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider Wearables and services together two areas where we have strategically invested in last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our top-line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago that's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue. Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue, while this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January including strong customer response to our in-store trade-in and financing programs.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">In fact, iPhone our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of $11.5 billion that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our Q2 performance. Our strong services performance was broad based, we set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the app store.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all five of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform and we remain on track to double our fiscal year '16 services revenue in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In May, we launched our all new Apple TV app in over 100 countries bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and select smart TV's. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content providers all in one place. Second, the same ease-of-use and unmatched user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well. And third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're engaging with this third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want. Our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more than twice the volume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning to rollout of New York City transit and will launch in Chicago later this year. In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for Didi the world's largest ride hailing provider.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for Wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last four quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We had great performance from iPad, with revenue of over $5 billion, and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students. And for our pro users, who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all new Pro Display XDR, which will be available this fall. They're designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough pricing and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pro customers.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last two quarters and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double-digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to the future. Last week we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second-largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our development of our future products and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms making them more powerful, more personal and more private.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with Dark Mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day, including photos, camera and maps. iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including Sign On with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and Web sites without sharing your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS, called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for your Mac.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big-screen experience even more personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi-user support, everyone in the family can get a more engaging and tailored experience with their favorite TV shows, movies, sports and news, along with Apple Music, photos and videos in iCloud, and an App Store with thousands of great games and apps.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">watchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Watch users stay healthy, active and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever. And of course, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. watchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warn about high decibel noise to protect your hearing and cycle tracking to aid in women's health care decisions.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and a regular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world, with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As I noted earlier, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. These updates are the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers. And these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease-of-use, their seamlessness and their privacy and security.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these platforms. And our customers, of course, benefit greatly from access to all this creativity and innovation.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple easy-to-use code. Core ML 3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models, and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We have the world's largest augmented reality enabled platform and thousands of they ARKit-enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR-based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">RealityKit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually lifelike. And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who have no 3D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps that these creators have in store in the months ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">On so many fronts there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Until then, thanks for joining us today. And for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Luca Maestri</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We return to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Overall, products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in products revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the one-time item, we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4% down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was $11,600,000,000.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter's 17% decline, with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In total, services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all time high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such as entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total services revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Among our many services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores there are over 1800 third-party Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as three years ago.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We also had great results for iPad, with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time high.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories. Our trade-in program is showing great momentum, with more than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington D.C. and the busy Shinji District in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In retail banking, two-thirds of top banks are deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer on-boarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Credit Suisse, Discover and T.D. Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. T.D. Ameritrade has also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open-market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We expect revenue to be between $61 million and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OINE to be about 200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, two from me. First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied I think up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at least, in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. Just can you help us understand, what gives you the confidence for a better than seasonal guide in September, either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Amit, it's Luca. Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. We have great momentum in wearables. We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter, or actually over 50% in the June quarter. Our services business, we set an all-time record in June. And so, these two categories have become really important and really large for us. And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Fair enough. That's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow-up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing that despite all the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that are driving the success in China, and how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, Amit, Hi. It's Tim, and I apologize for my voice, I'm suffering from an allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, services, everything improved sequentially. So, we couldn't be happier with the progress. I would point out, I think I mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. So, there's several things going on there that are quite positive.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about what's going on within services, some of the puts and takes? Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of what’s been going on with China and that, is this something that could reaccelerate, or again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But, how are you thinking about it?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. Clearly FX, plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. Our installed base continues to grow. It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That has helped our performance there.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. And obviously, as we go through the year those comps become a bit more difficult.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Having said all that, that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that, we wanted to double the size of the services business from our fiscal 2016 to 2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target, is important to us. It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. We’re already at 420 million now. So, we feel confident there.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important services that we’re going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and then of course Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we had in services.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Shannon Cross</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great. Thank you. And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth of top-line impact, I think from, currency last quarter. Then maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage. As you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so, we need to keep that in mind. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Shannon. Could we have the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June, and just curious if that’s something you saw in the business and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Katy, it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at that in quite much detail.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall services growth. Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year, or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March, and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. The other three services, the card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period up front, there's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what that what they look like. So, the road to monetization takes some time. Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen &amp; Company.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the iPhone sales came from the trade-ins and are there any other geographies where you are left to rule it out? Then, I have a follow-up.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter, we were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led the combination of retail and online, just short form that is retail Apple Store let to growth in June trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. Because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Got it. Got it. That's pretty helpful, Tim. And then, a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of the services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road, 3 or 5 years down the road, would the services growth still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone, or do you think at some point down the road services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. And so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get into that.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. And so, this is a really good thing.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&amp;D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out what's next there.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to growth there. We're very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you a view over the total.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And so, we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means there. They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you, Krish. Could we have the next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Next, we will go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Wamsi Mohan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. Thank you. Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and more recently you asked for some tariff exceptions were not granted those. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing and can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China. And I have a follow-up.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. The way I view this is, the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we want to continue doing that. And so, we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions. And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Wamsi Mohan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong and do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, Wamsi, as you know we're not getting into this topic very much. But, I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been traditionally what we've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. Hope that helps you with that.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks very much. The first question is probably to Tim and second one for Luca. I will ask them at the same time, so you can continue which other one you want to answer, first or second. While the first one is for Tim, regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year the past several quarters have been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of, how is the installed base growing? Is it mostly because secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding more phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all these wearables and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where now a lot of harvesting is going to happen or do you kind of continue this relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey, Jim, it's Tim, I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the to the iOS, macOS and so forth [indiscernible]. It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits an incremental customer. And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets to a lesser degree of people knew that they’re buying their first smartphone. There are still quite a few people in the world in that category. And so, the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is, switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs et cetera to try to increase that, because we think we wind up hitting a cost number that we don't hit in another way.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And the upgrades where people are holding onto their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then, you have the people in the new category as well. And so, that's sort of the equation. I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Luca Maestri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And Jim, on OpEx, obviously is very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&amp;D side, because we will always want to bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So, we will continue to do that. There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&amp;A portion of OpEx tightly. Of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card next month, obviously they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">When you look in total, where we are in terms of our expense to revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know, quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. So, we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time we will not under-invest in the business.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nancy Paxton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Samik Chatterjee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start-off with the announcement at WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPad. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? And how does that help you position wearables more firmly into the health and fitness category?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. I couldn't be happier with it. The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so, you look at all of these and all the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now for the developers readying their apps for the fall.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Samik Chatterjee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Got it. If I can just follow-up on the China market, one of the things that we're looking at is going into the New Year into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. How do you think about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tim Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">We don't comment on future products. With respect to 5G, I think most people would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. And even more so on a global basis. So, we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software and we wouldn't trade our position for anyone's.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Nancy Paxton</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you, Samik.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Boeing Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Ms. Maurita Sutedja, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Ms. Sutedja, please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Maurita Sutedja</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's second quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm Maurita Sutedja and with me today is Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Enterprise Performance &amp; Strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">After management comments, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. And as a reminder you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now, I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Dennis Muilenburg</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Maurita, and good morning. Let me start with the 737 MAX. The accidents that occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia continue to weigh heavily on us. We will always be sorry for the lives that have been lost and the families that have been impacted. These accidents affect all of us personally and reinforce the importance of the work that we do. We know lives depend on it and nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We're also committed to supporting the families and communities affected by the Lion Air and Ethiopian accidents. Earlier this month we pledged $100 million in funds to help support those families and communities. And last week we announced that $50 million from this pledge would be dedicated to providing near-term financial assistance to families of the victims. And we have partnered with renowned experts Kenneth Feinberg and Camille Biros on disposition of these funds.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now let me turn to the latest on the MAX technical updates. Last month the FAA directed us to address a specific condition of flight unrelated to MCAS that the planned software update did not previously address. We agreed with the FAA's decision and we are currently working on the software changes to address this requirement.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In addition, we are working with the FAA and other regulators to complete as many elements of the certification process as possible in parallel with the development of the software update. We will submit our final certification package to the FAA once we have satisfied all of their requirements, which we currently estimate will be in the September time frame.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">However, as we have consistently emphasized, it is the FAA and other global aviation regulators that will determine when the 737 MAX returns to service and we are working tirelessly to meet their requirements. The process is dynamic and involves constant dialogue on outstanding questions and open issues that will continue in the days and weeks ahead. We are committed to working with these regulators to satisfy all of the requirements and to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As I mentioned last quarter, as part of our commitment to continually improve safety as we have always done, we've established a new Board committee to review Boeing's policies and processes for the design and development of airplanes. The committee has sought input from outside experts, from both industry and government and is working expeditiously to conduct its review and provide any recommendations it deems appropriate.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In preparation for the safe return of the 737 MAX to service, we've conducted a dozen customer conferences with MAX operators around the world and nearly 225 simulator sessions to develop test and demonstrate the software. In addition, we conduct weekly technical calls with our customers worldwide to ensure that all the appropriate steps are being taken so that the fleet is fully prepared to return to service when the grounding is lifted.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">This involves having the necessary technical kits and expertise on hand while adopting a new airplane entry-into-service mindset in partnership with our customers. This also includes a comprehensive package of training and educational resources.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In April, we reduced the 737 production rate to 42 per month to accommodate the pause in MAX deliveries. Both within Boeing and our supply chain, we are using this time to improve the production system health and stability. As we said in our pre-release last week, our best current estimate is a return to service for the MAX that begins early in the fourth quarter. Based upon this estimate and other factors, we expect to be able to maintain our current production rate of 42 deliveries per month to be followed by incremental rate increases that would bring our production rate to 57 during 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As our efforts to support the 737 MAX's safe return to service continue, we will continue to assess our production plans. Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options, including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The grounding has also impacted our customers and their flight schedules. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month will also cause associated airplane delivery delays in the future. We've been in constant contact with our customers to support them during this difficult time and we'll continue to work closely with all of our customers around the world and deal with the impact individually customer by customer. As we announced last week, we are recognizing impact to our second quarter results from both the longer-than-expected lower production rate and also estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey, from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety, to the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events. We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now let me turn to an overview of our second quarter operating performance, followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and how we are maintaining financial discipline and prudently managing liquidity as we work through the safe return to service of the MAX.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">With that let's move to slide 2. During the quarter, we recorded revenues of $15.8 billion and core earnings per share of negative $5.82, reflecting the MAX charge as well as lower volume of 737 deliveries partially offset by higher defense and services volume. We recorded negative $0.6 billion of operating cash and paid $1.2 billion in dividends reflecting a 20% increase in dividends per share from last year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now let's look at the second quarter operating performance for our businesses. For the quarter, Commercial Airplanes generated revenue of $4.7 billion reflecting 90 deliveries and the $5.6 billion pre-tax MAX charge. We saw solid widebody activities in the quarter and our backlog remains healthy at more than 5,500 airplanes worth $390 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Also earlier this month, we launched our latest round of flight testing through our ecoDemonstrator program to assess new technologies from enhancing safety and environmental performance to improving the flying experience. We debut a Boeing 777 that will serve as the 2019 flying testbed for 50 projects. The majority of the test flights will fly on sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions and demonstrate the fuel's viability.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now over to Defense, Space &amp; Security. BDS reported second quarter revenue of $6.6 billion and booked $4 billion of new orders demonstrating the continued value we bring to our customers across our defense space and security portfolio. Those orders included contracts for a second lot of MH-47G Block II Chinooks for the U.S. Army; service life modification for the U.S. Navy's F-18 fleet; Wideband Global Satellite Communications for the U.S. Air Force; and a 5-year extension of Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits spares repairs and technical services for the U.S. Air Force.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Key milestones for BDS included the first T-X trainer program flight test on contract with U.S. Air Force and successful completion of the Starliner's final parachute test in preparation for upcoming launches. We delivered five KC-46 Tankers to the U.S. Air Force in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Year-to-date, we've delivered a total of 13 tankers. We look forward to continuing to work with our customer during their initial operational test and evaluation of KC-46 and we are committed to delivering the highest-quality product to our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to Global Services. BGS reported revenue of $4.5 billion representing 11% growth year-on-year. BGS continues to win new business highlighting the value we bring to our broad range of commercial and government customers and the strength of our One Boeing offerings.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">During the quarter BGS won new business totaling approximately $4 billion, which included Performance-Based Logistics contracts for AH-64 Apache for the U.S. Army and KC-767 Tanker for the Italian Air Force. BGS also received commitments from ASL Aviation Holding and GECAS for up to 45, 737-800 converted freighters.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And as announced at the Paris Air Show, we're excited about Boeing's first off-platform component service program with British Airways for the airline's A320 and A320neo aircraft.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Also in the quarter, aligned with our targeted vertical integration strategy to strengthen internal capabilities increase innovation and provide greater end-to-end value for our airline customers, we entered into an agreement to acquire EnCore Group an aerospace interiors company.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Additionally, through Boeing NeXt which leads our future mobility efforts, we announced the strategic partnership with Kitty Hawk Corporation to collaborate on future efforts to advance safe urban mobility. Progress also continues with the Embraer transaction as we work through regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We still expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In summary, our priority continues to be the safe return to service of the 737 MAX and we've continued to prioritize additional resources and focus on this effort. At the same time, we are maintaining our focus on keeping the business strong and healthy. As we demonstrated in the second quarter, our team continues to execute on operating performance and capture noteworthy additions to our large and diverse backlog.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. We continue to see healthy global demand for our offerings in commercial, defense, space and services. These are sizable sectors that are growing and backed by strong fundamentals with a combined market opportunity of $8.7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's up from $8.1 trillion in our previous forecast.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The increase was driven by strong commercial aviation fundamentals, airline productivity, widebody replacement demand and large stable defense and space markets as well as the need for life cycle services solutions. As a global company with customers in 150 countries, we are always mindful of the potential impact of geopolitical and macroeconomic forces.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We continue to track a host of near-term issues including the U.S.-China trade discussions. We believe in the mutual economic benefits of a strong and prosperous aerospace industry. In commercial aviation, while we have seen moderation of traffic in the first half of this year, global passenger traffic continues to grow faster than GDP and near long-term trends.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In 2018, we saw the ninth straight year of above-trend growth for passenger traffic. So far in 2019 passenger traffic has grown at a solid 4.6% through May. On the air cargo market, we saw a contraction in the year-to-date traffic. While we expect cargo traffic headwinds to linger in the near-term, we anticipate an improvement in the latter part of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our view of the demand fundamentals remains robust. We are highly confident in our industry outlook which now forecasts the demand for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. That's up from approximately 43,000 in our previous forecast, doubling the size of the global fleet and requiring a sizable ecosystem of life cycle solutions to maintain and support it.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We continue to see sustainable long-term growth in commercial aviation, powered by mature and emerging economies, a growing middle class, and continued innovation in business models and products.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The changing nature of travel has fundamentally expanded traffic patterns with improved accessibility and affordability. At the same time, airlines are maintaining capacity discipline and keeping supply and demand in balance. They are also more balanced between airplanes purchased for fleet growth and replacement.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Of the 44,000 new airplane demand, 44% will go towards replacing aging aircraft leading to more stable purchasing patterns. We believe the evolution in these key market dynamics in aggregate continues to drive less cyclicality for our industry.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">These long-term demand fundamentals provide a solid foundation for our commercial business. We are well-positioned in this market with a strong portfolio of airplanes, a large and diverse order backlog and a strong One Boeing team.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Additionally, we are forecasting demand for around 800,000 new civil aviation pilots and 770,000 new maintenance technicians over the next 20 years. About 80% of them will be for commercial aviation.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Meeting this strong demand will require a collective effort from across the global aviation industry. The aviation industry will need to adopt innovative training solutions to enable optimum learning and knowledge retention. The narrowbody segment will command the largest share of new deliveries.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We expect airlines to need more than 32,000 single-aisle airplanes in the next 20 years. These new airplanes will continue to stimulate growth and provide requirement -- and provide required replacements for older, less efficient airplanes.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our 737 program has a backlog of more than 4,400 aircraft and a production skyline that is sold out into early next decade. Last month International Airlines Group, one of the world's largest airline groups, signed a letter of intent to purchase 200 737 MAX jets. We are honored by their trust and confidence that IAG is placing in the 737 MAX and ultimately in the people of Boeing and our deep commitment to quality and safety above all else.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In the widebody segment, we have seen steady order activities for the 787 and the 777 and have high confidence in a meaningful increase in widebody replacement demand early next decade.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In the near-term, we continue to monitor and inform the U.S.-China trade discussions. China is an important part of the global aircraft market and progress on this front will help support our widebody production rates.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The current-generation 777 continued its steady sales momentum with two new orders from DHL in the quarter and 12 new commitments and letters of intent from Qatar Airways which we firmed up earlier this month and also from China Airlines and Turkmenistan Airlines. These provide further support for the 777 bridge.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to 777X, orders and commitments of 364 aircraft provide a strong foundation that supports our plan for ramping up production and delivery of this new aircraft. We continue to focus on further bolstering the 777X skyline.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On 777X development, our first two flight test airplanes are now in preflight testing. Overall the airplane is performing well in preflight tests with intermediate gauntlet and initial taxi tests completed during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our teams are currently focused on final systems, propulsion, and airplane level tests. However, the GE9X engine remains the pacing item as we work towards first flight. As we previously mentioned, GE, our engine supplier is working through some challenges with the engine that are putting risk on the overall test schedule.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Based on GE's latest assessment on what it will take to address these challenges, we are currently projecting that first flight will occur in early 2020 rather than in 2019 as we have previously mentioned. This scheduled flight is obviously disappointing given how well the aircraft has been performing in preflight tests and that we are on track on non-engine activities.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">While we continue to target 2020 for first delivery of the 777-9 the engine issue has added significant risk to the schedule. We continue to work closely with GE as well as explore opportunities to improve the schedule such as leveraging our system integration labs and additional airplane ground testing as we strive to meet this delivery target in a manner consistent with our commitment to safety.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We continue to expect 777 delivery rates to be approximately 3.5 aircraft per month in 2019. Given the pressure around 777X first delivery timeline, we are reassessing the 2020 skyline. In light of the strong demand for our freighter line, we intend to mitigate some of the impact by producing more 777 current-generation freighters in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to the 787 Dreamliner, in the quarter we saw Air New Zealand, Korean Airlines, and Air Lease Corporation announce their commitments to purchase a total of 33 787-9 and 787-10s. Korean Airlines firmed up their orders last week. Our 787 backlog stands at more than 550 airplanes. Similar to the 777X, we will continue to focus on further bolstering the 787 skyline.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On our 767 program, we added six new 767 freighter orders in the quarter and as previously announced, we plan to increase the 767 production rate from 2.5 per month to three per month in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">At Defense Space &amp; Security, we continue see solid demand for our major platforms and programs. Looking at the defense and space market for the next 10 years, we see a $2.5 trillion market of opportunities for our business. About 60% of that is in the U.S., so there's tremendous opportunity around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our strategy of global reach with local presence is key to our success. You see that across Europe, Australia, India, and the Middle East to name a few. The BDS portfolio is well-positioned with mature world-class platforms to address current needs and innovative capable and affordable new franchise programs to build the future.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We continue to see broad support for our products from the Pentagon, NASA, and Congress including for procurement of the Boeing F-15EX and F-18 fighter jets, Apache and V-22 Osprey rotorcraft, JDAM weapons, satellite programs, the Space Launch System, and key derivative programs like the KC-46 Tanker and the P-8. We have also seen robust support for our future franchise programs.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We are maintaining a clear focus on these future franchises, including the ongoing MQ-25 and T-X development programs and our NASA Commercial Crew and Space Launch System programs at the leading edge of space exploration. Additionally, we're focused on leveraging our work to date on GBSD to help deliver this essential national security capability.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Turning to the services sector. We see the $3.1 trillion services market over the next 10 years as a significant growth opportunity for our company. This is a very dynamic and exciting marketplace, one that is driven by new technology and a relentless drive for greater efficiency, reliability and safety. BGS provides agile cost-competitive services to our customers worldwide. The future of commercial and government aircraft and services will be increasingly centered on technology and data services to drive smarter business decisions in commercial aviation and improve the commercial passenger experience and to enhance war fighter safety effectiveness and mission readiness.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We aim to continue growing faster than the average services market growth rate of 3.5% as we further expand our broad portfolio of services offerings and continue to gain market share. Strong orders of $4 billion in the quarter reflect our customers' recognition of our value proposition in helping them optimize the performance of their fleets and reduce operational costs through the life cycle.

Before we discuss the second quarter results let me also touch on the 737 MAX and explain how the grounding has impacted our financials to date and what we're doing to focus on today and going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let's move to slide 4 please. As previously announced, BCA revenue and earnings were reduced by $5.6 billion of pretax charge related to our estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers or disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. As Dennis mentioned, we will deal with the impact individually, customer by customer and we will look at various forms of economic value that we can provide.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">While the entire estimated amount has been recognized as a charge in the second quarter, we will expect any concessions or other considerations to be provided over a number of years. Therefore, you can expect the impact on our cash flow to affect 2019 and beyond. We currently see this impact to be more front end-loaded in the first few years, but of course it will depend on individual discussions with our customers on considerations.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We also booked an additional $1.7 billion of program costs on the 737 in the second quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher costs associated with the longer-than-expected reduction in the production rate. These include additional fixed costs and other items such as labor escalation support, parts and material. These costs will be spread across the undelivered aircraft in the accounting block of approximately 3,100 units and therefore reduce the 737 program margin.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As you know, when the program margin is adjusted it will affect the current quarter and the booking margin for subsequent periods. Also as Dennis said, we continue to work with the civil aviation authorities to ensure the 737 MAX's safe return to service and these authorities will determine the timing and condition of return to service. For the purpose of our second quarter financial results we have assumed that the regulatory approval in the U.S. and other jurisdictions begin early in fourth quarter 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">While this assumption reflects our best estimate at this time, I just want to reiterate that the actual timing and condition of return to service will be determined by the regulatory authorities and could differ from this assumption and our estimate. Our current second quarter results also assume a gradual increase in the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 57 per month in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We will also assume airplanes produced during the grounding, which are stored and included in our inventory will be delivered over several quarters following return to service. Any changes to these assumptions could require us to recognize additional financial impact.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">With regards to cash, lower cash receipts due to fewer 737 deliveries and lower production rate combined with building and storing 737 aircraft adversely impacted operating cash in the quarter. Looking forward, the key drivers of our financial impact related to the 737 continue to be the return-to-service time line and conditions.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">The delivery ramp-up which will be dependent on how fast we can deliver the aircraft once the fleet returns to service and how fast our customers can accept the aircraft, but also the 737 production rate profile I discussed going forward; and discussions with customers regarding potential concessions and other considerations.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We expect our financial results to continue to be adversely impacted until we safely return the 737 MAX to service, ramp up production rates and resume deliveries to customers. We continue to perform detailed scenario planning around return to service and production rates, including analyzing the implications on our supply chain, customer fleet and deliveries to fully understand the range of financial outcomes.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We will continue to assess our current production plans and incorporate any new insights such as return-to-service time line, storage capacity and supply chain in our analysis to help inform us on whether further rate reduction or other options including a temporary shutdown of the MAX production are needed.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As discussed last quarter, we've taken steps amid current challenges to preserve the future value and growth of this important franchise program for our company and for our customers. The production rate adjustment to 42 per month we instituted starting in April has helped our factory health and also supply our progress to getting back to master schedule and improving consistency and stability.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We've also taken actions to prudently manage our liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility including raising additional debt. These actions also include even sharper focus on productivity and strategic prioritization of spending. We will continue to diligently review all levers available to minimize the financial impact.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">As discussed last quarter given the dynamic 737 MAX return-to-service time line and activities we're not in the position today to provide forecast of the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our full year 2019 financials.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We will provide you with an updated full year 2019 financial forecast when we have returned to service the MAX fleet our production plans and delivery ramp-up profile and corresponding financial impacts. Returning MAX safely to flight continues to be priority one for us. It has been a team effort that leverages the best talent from across Boeing and also outside experts.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">The operating rhythm and the momentum of our cross-functional team has not let up since day 1. The team continues to meet daily with our Executive Council fully engaged.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We will continue to apply whatever resources are required to return the 737 MAX safely into the fleet and take the time necessary to do so working hand-in-hand with our customers. At the same time we'll also remain focused on our priorities delivering results with excellence.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So with that let's move to slide 5 and I'll discuss our second quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $15.8 billion with core earnings per share of negative $5.82 reflecting lower 737 deliveries and the MAX charge partially offset by higher defense and services volume.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Our Commercial Airplane business revenue decreased to $4.7 billion during the quarter reflecting the 737 MAX charge and lower 737 deliveries partially offset by favorable mix.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">BCA booked negative operating margins in the quarter due to the 737 MAX impact partially offset by higher 787 margins. BCA backlog continues to remain strong at $390 billion and more than 5500 aircraft creating more than six years or production.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Let's now turn to Defense Space &amp; Security results on slide 7. Second quarter revenue increased to $6.6 billion reflecting higher volume across derivative aircraft, government satellites, weapons and new franchise programs. It was partially offset by lower F/A-18 volume.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our margins of 14.7% in the quarter include continued focus on productivity and a $200 million gain on a sale of property. Similar to what we saw last quarter the sale of this excess property is the result of the team's continued market based affordability efforts to optimize our footprint and productivity. During the quarter BDS won key contract awards worth $4 billion and our backlog stands at $64 billion with 31% from outside the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Let's now turn to Boeing Global Service results on slide 8. In the second quarter Global Services revenue increased to $4.5 billion reflecting the acquisition of KLX and higher international government services volume. Year-over-year growth of 11% for the quarter continues to outpace the average annual service market growth rate of 3.5%.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">BGS booked operating margins of 15.1% and as I mentioned before BGS margins quarter to quarter are subject to fluctuations due to factors such as mix of products and services as well as performance on individual contracts. During the quarter BGS won key contract awards worth approximately $4 billion bringing its backlog now to $20 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Let's now turn to cash flow on slide 9. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was negative $590 million driven by lower 737 deliveries and production rate offset by solid underlying performance and timing of receipts and expenditures.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">As mentioned earlier, we expect continued working capital pressure to adversely affect cash flow until MAX deliveries resume. Strong operating cash flow from other parts of the business a strong balance sheet and future balance sheet levers will help provide adequate liquidity during this period.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">In the second quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and as I previously mentioned until we have clarity on the 737 return to service, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase program. However our long-term balanced cash deployment strategy and commitment remains unchanged.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $9.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. As I mentioned earlier, we raised additional debt in the quarter increasing the balance by $4.5 billion to help shore up the liquidity position as we work through the current MAX challenges.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet provides us with substantial borrowing capacity through capital markets access and unused credit facility of $6.6 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our long-term goals and strategic objectives remain unchanged. We will continue to use our three business unit strategy as a key differentiator in the marketplace, make prudent investments and leverage talent and innovation across the company.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So in summary, while focusing on the very important priority of a safe 737 MAX return to service and minimizing the significant impact on our customers and the flying public, our team keeps the core operating management, strong delivering results and meeting customer commitments. We recognize that we have a lot of work and not insignificant challenges in front of us in the weeks and months to come, but we're confident we have the right focus, team and resources to navigate through them.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">We're committed to providing you with additional updates on the MAX return-to-service progress and production plans as we have more information. We'll strive to continue to keep all of our stakeholders informed through public statements and information posted on our website. Once we have further clarity, we will schedule a follow-up investor and media call to discuss the financial impacts and provide revised guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So with that, I'll turn it back over to Dennis for closing comments.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Dennis Muilenburg</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">All right. Thank you, Greg. These are challenging times, first and foremost for the families and loved ones affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">This is a defining moment for Boeing, and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company. We'll stay true to our enduring values, while driving operational excellence across the enterprise. The safe return to service of the 737 MAX is our company's top priority.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I want to thank my Boeing teammates, who are delivering on this priority and on our other commitments of executing on our key priorities for our customers driving growth and operational excellence across the business in close partnership with our customers and suppliers and returning value to our shareholders. From engineers to analysts, to our factory teams and field service reps, to designers and planners, and to everyone at Boeing who has worked tirelessly to apply our culture of continuous improvement and learn from these events to innovate, to challenge, and to improve you have my sincerest thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I'm humbled and inspired by the response of the people of Boeing and our many partners. The shared responsibility of safety binds us together and reinforces our purpose and mission as an aerospace leader.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">The long-term fundamentals for our businesses remain strong and our key priorities are unchanged. Our One Boeing advantage has never been clearer, and we will leverage this unique strength to deliver and improve on our commitments to our customers and our partners around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">With that, we'll take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p9"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey, good morning gentlemen.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, Carter.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi. Greg, can you help us understand the relative degree of confidence you had or used to reach the financial impacts you announced last week and maybe how you thought about the variability in outcomes there, especially, I guess in the context of a temporary line stoppage that you both mentioned in your prepared remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then I guess related you said the phasing of those impacts would be front end-loaded, but can you maybe help us understand how you're thinking about that impact on the kind of higher-level multi-year cash flow trend you've talked about in the past? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, look obviously our booking position for the second quarter is our best estimate. And that's our best estimate based on a variety of inputs that we take into consideration and our engagement with the regulators, our software schedule, and our production plans the storage that you brought up all of that coming together in the second quarter. And again, that's our best estimate at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Now, as I said and Dennis said, obviously, some of those assumptions could change from here and if they do, they could have financial impact further than what we've booked in the second quarter and we'll keep you up-to-date if that's the case. But again, based on all that information, that's the best estimate we've got right now.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And as far as the path forward on the customer concessions as we've said, we're working and will continue to work with each of our customers and talk about how we can help through this period around the grounding of the aircraft, but also as we move deliveries out. And those will be individual conversations customer by customer, but likely be multiyear-type I'll say financial outcomes and particularly around cash.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As we see it today, it’d probably be a little more front-loaded into 2019 and some of the early years, but then phase out over that period. But again, this will be based on individual conversations and we'll pull that together as those conversations become more mature.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As you look at the cash profile going forward, I maybe step back a little bit and take the MAX out of the equation for a second, and tell you that the balance of the company and I'd say the key puts and takes that we saw pre-MAX remain intact. So, all those fundamentals are still intact. The real obviously outlier here is the MAX. And if the MAX returns to service based on the estimate that we have right now, then you'll obviously see significant cash in 2020 that will really be driven by those airplanes being delivered off the ramp at a higher rate, but as well as the production rate increases that we've talked about.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But until we have complete clarity on exactly that return-to-service date, and then the associated deliveries and production plan it's obviously TBD at this point. But again, the fundamentals remain intact and the objective certainly remains intact as well of having this year-over-year long-term cash flow objective. And like I said, the operating engine outside of MAX continues to achieve the results we expect.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And again lots of puts and takes as we move into the future years, but those are bounded very similar to the way they were pre-MAX. So it really is dependent on MAX return to service, and then that ramp-up from there. And as I said, we'll continue to keep you posted on that.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So it basically just sounds like the working capital reversal and the phasing of the settlements are the two big moving items for 2020?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. Certainly, yeah as you think about 2020 like I said delivering off the ramp and not only our ability to deliver off the ramp at a higher rate, but as I said the customers ability to take those; the concessions and considerations as you said; obviously lower advances at this lower production rate that you're seeing currently and you'll continue to see; and then the 777, 777X schedule that Dennis talked about. So yeah, there's lots of moving pieces within there, but we're clear-eyed on all of those and we're running various scenarios around those and taking a lot of action as we indicated on the prior call to try to mitigate some of that risk.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So all this effort in the factory, and all this effort in the supply chain to get stable to get folks back on schedule and get productivity initiatives that we had planned for the year and using these additional resources to get those mature and ready, so when we do go up in rate and we do start delivering off the ramp, we're doing that in a most efficient way possible. So that's kind of the investment, I'd say, we're making currently to ensure and minimize that risk as we get return to service and start to put the airplanes back into the hands of our customer.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Great. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">You’re welcome.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Thank you very much. So the 777X schedule slip, what is the financial impact both in terms of – what does your skyline for next year look like? Can you hold the Classic at three and half per month? And what does it mean in terms of when the cash outlay for the 777X will peak? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. Hey, Cai let me jump in on that first and then I'll ask Greg to add on. First of all, just to give you a little additional context on 777X schedule on the airplane side of the effort, we've been very pleased with the progress. And over the last quarter, as we mentioned we did the final gauntlet test, so think of those as the airplane-level system integration tests in the factory. And we also did our initial low-speed and high-speed taxi tests under power.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">All of that was very effective. We're very pleased with the results. So the airplane side of the equation here is progressing on plan and one of the cleanest development programs that we've seen. We're disappointed by the slip in the engine schedule and GE is steadily working through that challenge and getting their arms around the precise schedule for recovering. We'll be proceeding through engine testing as that solution becomes clear, but that does push our first flight out into early 2020, as we're currently projecting. We still expect this year to be our peak expenditure level on the 777X development program, but you're going to see the cash profile where we had hoped to get into the tailwind part of the program next year. You're going to see that extend out as first flight is extended out. Greg, do you want to add some additional color on that as well?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. No, I think – I think Dennis framed that perfectly. And obviously looking at 777 opportunities and obviously we're seeing continued demand for that product and particularly around the freight market, and so we're feathering that in with this current revised schedule Cai. And really that's an opportunity to meet the demands of our customer, but minimize the financial impact to us.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So lots of moving pieces in there, but we're continuing to work it. And like I said, the 777 continues to remain strong. It's certainly helping us through this period. And then the 777X skyline we talked about our priorities when it comes to widebodies in the market and certainly 777X and 787 continue to be high priority of filling in that skyline. So like Dennis said, we're disappointed considering the progress that's been made on the program. And these investments, we made to de-risk the development phase of the program, we're seeing the benefit of that today, but we're disappointed by where we are with that – with this engine. So we're trying to get ahead of this Cai and putting mitigating actions in place and really again minimize the impact on us, and ultimately on our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And as Greg said, the encouraging thing is the current 777 continues to do well in the marketplace. So we still expect our factory to be running a five per month production rate next year as we said our delivery rate of about three and half per month this year and we'll be looking at the exact delivery mix next year within that production rate the exact delivery mix of 777 to 777X. And so that's work that's still underway. We've got some work to do.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">You’re welcome.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And next we go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Hunter Keay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you everybody. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning, Hunter.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Hunter Keay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Regarding the comment around potentially suspending the MAX line, when will you need to make a decision on that? What are some of the gating factors? And then – and once you resume deliveries what's the bigger concern between the customer's ability to accept and your ability to deliver it? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah, Hunter first of all, when we take a look at the overall MAX plan and return-to-service plan as we said, our current best estimate is that, we return to service early in the fourth quarter. And as long as we remained solid on that assumption, we believe we can maintain our current 42 per month production rate, and as we said incrementally step back up to 57 a month as we go into 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Now, if that estimate of return to service substantially changes then we'll have to consider alternatives. And every day, we are doing scenario planning, working through every dimension of this program. We're looking at the ongoing software update development, the regulatory approvals, the certification process, the return-to-service process, working hand-in-hand with our customers, supply chain health, production system health every dimension of the program. And we have that knit together. We understand it. We understand the ripple effects of any changes to the schedule, and we're going to continue to monitor that on a day-to-day basis.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Currently, and as I said daily, we're working with the FAA, EASA and other regulators as we step through the certification process headed back to ungrounding the fleet. We have a clear understanding of the work that has to be done, but there is still uncertainty in the time line. And we do have to go through a multi-regulator approval process and it's a complex process and one that will take time to get done.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The important thing here is everything is based on safety of the airplane. We are confident that when the 737 MAX returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly. That is the most important thing here. We're going to take the time necessary to ensure its safe.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And as I said if any of the time line assumptions change significantly from a start of the fourth quarter return to service, then we'll have to evaluate alternatives. And those alternatives could include different production rates. They could include a temporary shutdown of the line, not something we want to do, but an alternative that we have to prepare for, I think it's a smart part of our thorough and disciplined process here to make sure we're covering all scenarios.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Hunter Keay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Next, we go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">David Strauss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Dennis, you talked about a software fix for this latest issue that the FAA identified. Are you sure it's a software fix at this point and not also potentially a hardware fix? And then, it's also being reported that EASA has five mutual requirements before it'll lift the MAX grounding. Is that in fact accurate? It seems to be more encompassing of what the FAA is talking about. And if so, is that accurate, they have these five requirements? And if so, is meeting those lineup what the September time frame that you've outlined? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. David, let me give you a little context there. So, first of all, on the software update that's going on, we are confident that is a software update not a hardware update. Our process here as we step through certification is, we have the regulators come in and fly in our simulator and we test out a number of different conditions that are all part of the final certification. And during those simulator sessions, we identified this additional scenario that with the FAA, we decided that we would make this software update to mitigate a potential risk. And this was a simulated failure in our -- in the microprocessor of the airplane as previously reported.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">That is a software update to address that risk area. It's an understood update and we're in the middle of working our way through that. The time line for approving that update and finishing up the certification is still uncertain as we're working through the details with the regulators. The FAA has also convened a number of multi-regulator boards and reviews and venues to bring in EASA, Transport Canada, Brazil, other regulators from around the world. And those convening sessions are bringing all of the questions to the table that any of the regulars have.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So the reports that you mentioned about the five questions from EASA, all of the questions from all of the regulators around the world are being brought together, convened and integrated with the FAA's leadership. So all of those inputs have been considered in our current timeline analysis and are all consistent with the time line that we've laid out here for submitting our certification package in the September time frame and a return to service in the October time frame. Now again, that's a time line that we base-lined for the moment, but there's still uncertainty in the exact process that the regulators will step through.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Seth Seifman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks very much and good morning. Follow-up on a couple of questions that have been asked already and hopefully not be too repetitive. But just in terms of how you think about the rate and where the line should be? I appreciate the fact that you guys have to be very disciplined and thorough in your planning. But as we've seen over the past few months, it's not surprising to see the dates move around here and there. And when you balance some of the risks of continuing to producing 42 without delivering versus the risk that would emerge on the supply chain if you were to cut the rate significantly, I mean, is it safe to say that the type of slips that we've seen already which is a couple of months here and a couple of months there don't necessarily affect the rate?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. Seth, I guess the way to think about that is, we're continually assessing all of these different pressure points in the system and supply chain health is certainly one of the key considerations for us as we think about the production rate. We're also taking a look at storage capacity and our ability to take care of the airplane from the field, our return-to-service time line and the effect that will have on our customers and the work that needs to be done on preparing the airplanes.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So we're taking a look through all dimensions of these pressure points around the schedule. And no one item is going to drive the schedule. This is balancing all of the inputs in perspective. So, I won't make any dramatic assumptions around any one parameter. It's more of a balancing act as we continue to look at all of these dimensions.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Seth Seifman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Next, we go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hey Rob.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Dennis, you've said it a couple of times on the call now that you'd have the fix-in you think by September and hopefully recertification in October. Given that the FAA is in the building and working with you on this, what are the mechanics of what happens in that one month? Is the idea here that they will have already vetted most of this before they even receive the official submission? And then the other part of the question is, are you -- is discovery over here and we are just implementing and testing? Or is discovery -- new discovery still ongoing? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. Rob, I would characterize this as an iterative process. So we are in daily communication with the FAA and other regulators. Our teams are daily working on software updates, running through simulator sessions. There's a great deal of certification -- documentation that needs to be completed.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So all of that engineering work is underway. As we complete that work and complete the documentation of what's called the system safety assessment that will lead into the final formal certification process, which will include a certification flight test. And then subsequent to that flight test we'll submit the final documentation that will go through the FAA's normal approval process.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">In parallel to that we have a number of pilot evaluations that will be done. There's a joint operational evaluation board that will look at the training dimension of bringing the MAX back up and flying. So all of these are parallel activities that we're working jointly with the regulators but it is an iterative process. And as we go through those iterations it's possible that we will discover new items.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So our goal is over time to close out uncertainty, answer questions that are coming in from the regulators. We're making good, steady progress on that. We see convergence, so we know we're making progress. But until we complete all of the certification activities there's always some risk of new items opening up. And so that's why we try to be very disciplined about the engineering process here but also our scenario planning to account for any of these potential uncertainties. And until we get through the final certification step and we all confirm that the airplane is safe, we won't return to service. So that's really the pacing item here.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Raviv</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks, everyone. Dennis, can you give us some perspective on the widebody market please, some thoughts on why you're not over supplying as some of your competitors might have suggested and also how you're achieving what some have suggested are very aggressive prices?</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And then just a little bit also on the near-term versus long-term dynamics in that market, including China. Why is that a near-term driver and then more of a replacement dynamic in the 2020s? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yeah. You bet Jon. Well, a couple of things. One, as you look at our current market outlook as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to see strong overall growth. And if you look at the next 20 years, the world needs about 44,000 new commercial airplanes, up from about 43,000 in our previous forecast.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So directionally the market continues to expand. The fundamentals are solid and passenger traffic in particular continues to expand. A key part of that future demand is the widebody marketplace. We continue to see a significant wave of replacement demand early in the next decade as we've said before. And we believe our 787 and 777X families are perfectly positioned for that replacement wave that's coming. And you can see that our products are winning in the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Despite a fairly tough marketplace in terms of overall orders, so far this year our widebody segment has been doing well. And we've been winning in the marketplace with both the 787 and the 777X and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing customers.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So I can't comment on our competitors' comments that you mentioned but I can comment on the fact that our customers see value in the 787 Dreamliner and 777X. That's showing up in orders. And while we still have work to do on the skyline as we noted for both 777X and 787, we feel confident in the production rates that we've laid out. And you've seen that with the 787 currently running at 14 a month, we're continuing to gain efficiency on that line and that's allowing us to be even more competitive in the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So we're going to be mindful about filling the future skyline. We're mindful of those risks and we'll continue to pay attention to that. But the long-term marketplace for widebodies is solid and our family of products is well-positioned to compete and win.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Raviv</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thanks. I’ll stick to one.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Next we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yeah, hey good morning guys.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Good morning Ron.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">So one thing that really hasn't come up too much in the call is where do we stand on NMA. And on NMA when we kind of stand back and look at it, given the difficulties that we run into on the MAX and the difficulties on 78 and the difficulties on 74-8 and the difficulties on KC-46, how do we get comfortable around NMA? And can you just talk about that?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yeah Ron. First of all to put it in context, we continue to have a dedicated team that's working on NMA, working through our business case. Our assessment of the market opportunity hasn't changed. We see a potential market there for 4,000 to 5,000 aircraft and we continue to see significant customer interest in that marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">But in terms of relative priorities, it's clear that our top priority is getting the 737 MAX return to service safely and so we have prioritized that in terms of resourcing and focus for our company. And that will be first and that is ahead of our NMA work.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">That said, we're continuing to progress on building our business case and when and if that business case closes, we would make a launch decision. We still see it as a two-step decision process as we've described previously. And we're not going to run to any artificial time line. We're going to make decisions based on disciplined data and as the business case close.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">Part of that business case is addressing development program risk as you noted and we are investing significantly in improving development program performance. We know it's an area that needs continued improvement going forward. This gets in all the work we're doing on things like model based engineering, our digital transformation, production system of the future. These are all important elements of reducing development cost and also de-risking development programs for the future. That's all part of what goes into the business case for NMA and our confidence in the maturity of those new tools and the ability to implement them at scale on our development program will be part of the decision process.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Harned</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you, good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Good morning, Doug.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Harned</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">On the MAX, as you look toward presumably the September time frame, one of the issues that's been out there has been training requirements. And if you look across a number of aviation authorities there, appear to be very different views also across airlines. When you consider different scenarios for what training requirements will be whether they're full simulator computer-based, how could that affect your ability to deliver even if we get certification in the time frame that you're hoping it will occur?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yeah, Doug. That's another area that we're paying close attention to and working daily. So as part of our ongoing work, not only the software update on the MAX, we've also made a comprehensive update to the training materials and expanded educational resources. And that is being done in concert again with regulatory authorities and with our customers around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">In fact, we've conducted, as I mentioned earlier, hundreds of simulator sessions with customer pilots around the world to get their inputs on the training packages and some of the updates that we're making. So that work is going on in parallel. The next significant waypoint in that process is something that's called the Joint Operational Evaluation Board.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">That is a convening of regulators and government pilots that will fly the airplane with the updated software. They will evaluate the training curriculum and will make final recommendations on the overall training requirements.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And we have prepared a comprehensive set of computer-based training modules that we're confident will address the training needs for the MAX. But in addition to that, we've also prepared options and are continuing to work through options for simulator-based training for airlines that may want that or regulatory agencies that may require it.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And we do expect in the end that we'll have a consistent set of computer-based training that all airline customers will use and there will likely be some selective use of simulator-based training. It depends on the maturity of the fleets and whether they already have MAX aircraft or whether MAXes are new to their fleet. It depends on their pilot training curriculum.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Some airlines will use simulator training as part of their normal recurrent training. Some may want training upfront before they fully return the fleet to service. So that can be a pacing item, Doug, as you noted and it's another one of those uncertainty elements that we're working our way through.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">That's why when we say return to service early in the fourth quarter we have to work through all of these uncertainties: the software update and the certification of the airplane itself as well as the training curriculum as well as preparation for all of our customers to get the fleet back up and running.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And we have good understanding of each of those workflows. We know the work that has to be done. We are on it on a daily basis. But the exact time line for completing all of that and getting regulatory approval across the board is still uncertain, and that's why we keep saying we've made our best estimate of that time line, but we're also protecting for uncertainty of that time line with our scenario planning.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Harned</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Next we go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Thanks. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">I was hoping that you could comment on -- with the new updated time line if you have made changes to those suppliers you're maintaining at a higher than 42 a month rate. And then, also if you can maybe talk about the logic between a temporary shutdown versus just a more significant leg down in your production rate of 42. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. Myles, a couple of things. One is our solution on the supply chain plans and the scenario planning we're doing varies by supplier. So we have some that are supplying at our production rate, others that are continuing to run at higher than our 42 a month production rate. It's really tailored supplier-by-supplier. In some cases, we had suppliers who were behind schedule, and we'd use the opportunity here to catch up to master schedule as Greg mentioned.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Obviously CFM with the engine, Spirit on the fuselage as examples there where we've been able to increase -- improve our production's health and stability by having them run at a higher than 42 a month production rate. With CFM, for example, we're also working to sustain that higher production rate to make sure we have sufficient engine spares available when we return to service. So each of these are tailored plans, and it's all part of the supply chain health that we're thinking our way through with more than 600 suppliers on the MAX program.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Regarding your latter questions, we think through production system planning, it depends on the time line and our understanding of the time line. If we are able to maintain our early fourth quarter return to service again we hold it at 42 a month production rate, if we have a significant change we would consider alternatives.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Stepping down to a lower production rate below 42 a month, presents some challenges more broadly to our supply chain synchronization of our workforce as well, learning how you would consider ramping back up later and the impact of that. So in some cases, depending on time line, a temporary shutdown of production line could be more efficient than a sustained lower production rate. And that's what we're thinking our way through.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">If you had a temporary shutdown if it was necessary that is one way to reduce the outflow of airplanes and the storage requirements while to a degree maintaining supply chain health and workforce learning for consistency in the production system. So we're thinking through all of those parameters and making sure we have all those scenarios available.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Maurita Sutedja</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">And we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Thank you. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Good morning, Sheila.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Just to elaborate on the global demand environment a little bit more, what are your thoughts on air traffic decelerating close to the 4% to 5% long-term rate? What are watch items there? And as it relates to that, how do you think about the service business and implication from the MAX to that segment? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yes, Sheila, on the overall market, the fact that we've been operating at a 4.6% passenger traffic growth through May, is not surprising to us. We expected some slowdown in the early part of the year. Some of this has been driven by local effects. The MAX, to a degree, has played into this. Local airport shutdowns in a couple of key locations have impacted it.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">But we don't really see a macro driver behind the passenger traffic numbers year-to-date and it is consistent with the longer-term trend of continuing to grow it faster than GDP. So our overall confidence in the market and our 20-year growth outlook, our current market outlook, remains solid. And I wouldn't read anything more than that into the passenger traffic stats that we've seen so far this year. And the second half of your question was?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Service business.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">On the services business.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Smith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">The MAX, yes.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">So, on the MAX impact, we have seen some impact of the MAX grounding on our services business. Things like engine overhauls, for example, have been pulled back a bit as we have customers who are keeping existing airplanes in service longer, because of the less capacity in their fleets.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">They're deferring some engine overhaul work, so some ripple effect into our services business. I wouldn't say it's extensive, but some impact that we've seen. And again, we expect that to be localized and temporary, nothing that we're seeing as a long-term trend change.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Ms. Anne Toulouse, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Toulouse, please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Anne Toulouse</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Thanks, John. Good morning. We'll continue with questions for Dennis and Greg. For those in media, if you have additional queries following this session please call our team at (312) 544-2002. Operator, we're ready for that first question. And in interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">And first we go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Julie Johnsson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Hi. Dennis, you've talked in the past about how the MAX experience has been. The last few months have been gearing for your personally, but just an enormous challenge for Boeing. And there's been some discussion of lessons learned and I think a lot of people would like to actually hear a little bit more about what those are. And what's changed in terms of how Boeing operates and how it approaches designing and certifying aircraft?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yes, Julie, let me make a few comments on that note. I appreciate the question. Certainly, it's been a challenging time for us as a company, but more broadly across the aviation industry. And one, I think, this whole situation has certainly reinforced the importance that we place on safety and quality and reminded us of the importance of the work we do. And we know that lives depend on the work we do and this is just further reinforcing that and reinforcing our commitment to safety and quality. And in the end, that's going to make us a better, stronger company.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">We are taking a look at all of our airplane design and certification processes end-to-end. As you know, we have a Board Committee that we've stood up and they're doing a lot of hard work right now, looking through all of our processes. We also have a number of external government reviews that are ongoing, looking at certification processes. Any learnings from that we will certainly incorporate going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">And then, we're also taking a look at things around communications and integration and how we can make sure safety issues if found or recognized, those quickly come to the surface, can be dealt with, that we have effective communications with our customers and all the constituencies that are involved. And those are changes that we'll be making as well for any lessons learned. This is all about ensuring that we have the right safety and quality culture for the future. We have a very solid foundation of that today, but we also know we can always get better and that's our focus.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Our next question is from Eric Johnson with Reuters. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Hi. Thank you. Dennis, so do I understand it correctly that you have to sell more 777 freighters to avoid a slowdown in 777 output due to the 777X delays? And how easy is that at a time of global trade tensions?</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Yes, Eric, as I said, we look at the skyline mix through 2020. With the delay in first flight of the 777X, it's obviously going to put pressure on entry-into-service timing. We're still holding 2020 for first delivery.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">But we know there's clear pressure on that, given the delays in first flight. So we are taking a look at production skyline mix in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">And as we mentioned earlier, we anticipate that means we'll probably build more current-generation 777s, 777 freighters in that time frame. The good thing is the market signals are positive there.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">We've made progress on continuing to sell 777 freighters including during this last quarter. We continue to see strong demand signals there. And so our ability to maintain the production system at five a month and alter the delivery mix between 777s and 777X.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">We're confident we can do that. We have work to do to fill out the specific orders and delivery slots. But the good news is that the 777 bridge is strong and we continue to see a lot of demand for the 777 freighter.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Next we go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""question"">Dominic Gates</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Good morning. The news you've delivered today, gives us two very different scenarios for production in Renton. The one scenario there's a possible shutdown. And the other scenario, you're ramping up from 42 to 57 a month in a year basically.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">I just want you to address, how -- they look like there are some optimistic assumptions in there. You're going to fly the plane in September is your hope. But usually after a flight test it takes weeks for the FAA to process the documentation. And analyze all the data from the flight test.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">So it does seem optimistic that you would then enter service in October. And then, it seems equally optimistic that you could ramp up from 42 to 57 in a year. You normally take a lot of incremental pieces that takes half a year to get from 42 up to 57.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">So, what is the trigger for which scenario happens in Renton? If you slip into next year for entry into service, does that mean a shutdown?</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dennis Muilenburg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Yeah, Dominic there's no one specific trigger. Again, as I said, we're laying out a multitude of scenarios given all the variables in the schedule here. Our current best estimate, as we said is to deliver our certification package, including the certification flight in that September time frame. And then return to service in the -- early in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">And you're right, post certification flight it's typically a process that's measured in a number of weeks with the regulators including the FAA to evaluate all of that data, to confirm it, and to give us approval to unground the fleet and return to service. We have taken our best estimate at that and factored that into the analysis and numbers that we shared with you today.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And we are assessing that on a daily basis and working hand-in-hand with the FAA in this process. And we are dependent on the FAA and other regulators for achieving that time line. And we're going to work very closely with them to do that. If that time line changes significantly, we will have to evaluate these other scenarios.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And, there's no one specific trigger, but know that we're going to continually look at this as, what is the optimum solution for our customers, to ensure first of all safety of flight and to help them return to service in a healthy way.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And while we do that maintain production system health, both within our own factory in Renton as well as our supply chain health. That includes a very close focus on our workforce, the health of our workforce, stability of our workforce as well as all these other parameters around storage and other factors that play into the schedule.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">Now we're going to continue to balance all of those. To your point about our ability to ramp up later, I will remind you that, we have been at higher production rates previously. So we have experienced, not only up to 57 a month, but at 52 a month.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And that experience, that learning, that understanding, gives us confidence in how we can rate back up. And we've factored that into our analysis as well. And I think you've also noted that, even though we have stepped down to 42 a month on our production rate, we have held our workforce in Renton.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And we place incredible value on our teammates there. And the incredible work that they do. And we're working every dimension we can to preserve that workforce and maintain that learning for future production system ramp-up, so all of these things are factoring into our decision process.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong>Anne Toulouse</strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">That's going to conclude our earnings call. So again if you're a member of the media, and you have additional question, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Thanks.</p>]"

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll. Ma’am, the floor is yours.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar second quarter earnings call. Joining us today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, CFO; and Kyle Epley, Vice President of our Global Finance Services Division. We’ve provided slides to accompany the presentation. You can find them along with our earnings news release in the Investors section of the caterpillar.com under Events &amp; Presentations.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We will also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information discussed. For details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause actual results to vary materially from our projections, please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in today’s news release. As indicated on last quarter's call, we're not reporting adjusted profit per share again this quarter, as restructuring costs are expected to be lower in 2019. It’s our intention to report adjusted profit per share at the end of the first -- fourth quarter of 2019 to exclude any mark-to-market gain or loss for the re-measurement of pension and any other post-employment benefit plans, as well as any other discrete items.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As a reminder, our U.S. GAAP-based guidance for profit per share continues to include the benefit of the $0.31 discrete tax item we recognized in the first quarter. Please keep in mind that Caterpillar has copyrighted this call. We expressly prohibit use of any portion of the call without our written approval. Before I turn the call over to Jim, let me inform you about a change we're making due to investor preferences around the timing of earnings calls. Beginning next quarter, we plan to shift our earnings call to begin at 8:30 AM Eastern Time. This timing allows us to conclude our call before the U.S. stock market opens. Accordingly, we also plan to accelerate the news release timing to 6:30 AM Eastern Time beginning next quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And, with that, I now turn the call over to Jim. </p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jim Umpleby</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to slide 3 for our second quarter highlights. Sales and revenues this quarter rose 3%, to $14.4 billion. Operating profit rose 2% to $2.2 billion. Profit per share of $2.83 was slightly ahead of last year's record second quarter of $2.82. We delivered strong operating cash flow of $2 billion in the quarter. At our Investor Day in May, we announced our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividend growth and more consistent share repurchases.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As previously announced, we recently increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $1.03 per share or $4.12 on an annualized basis. So far in 2019, we paid dividends of almost $1 billion. In addition, we repurchased about $1.4 billion in company stock this quarter, which brings the total to about $2.1 billion for the year. From a top line perspective, we experienced strong sales in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Overall, demand remains positive. While some customers appear to be more cautious about making large capital expenditures, including in oil and gas, we continue to expect modest sales growth for the year. We are only two-and-a-half years into our recovery in many of our end markets. While we had strong top line sales, we experienced some unfavorable changes in mix and higher-than-expected restructuring charges. Andrew will discuss both of these items later in the call. Although, we are guiding you to the lower end of the profit per share range, we still expect 2019 profit per share to be higher than the record we set in 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now, let's review over 2019 expectations for the external environment on Slide 4. In Construction Industries, we expect -- we continue to expect North America will be a positive for us. This is due in part to infrastructure spending at the state and local level although we expect that to be partly offset by weakness in residential construction.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Asia-Pacific, we expect continued pressure from competitive pricing in China, partly offset by growth in other areas in Asia-Pacific. EAME is a mixed bag. Sales in Europe are projected to be steady, while Africa and the Middle East remain weak. Latin America continues to improve from very low levels.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We expect demand for heavy construction as well as quarry and aggregate equipment to remain strong in Resource Industries this year. Most commodity prices remain at investable levels. Mining equipment sales continue to improve and large mining truck sales have further room for growth to reach their normal replacement levels. We continue to anticipate that miners will remain disciplined in our capital expenditures in these early stages of their multiyear recovery.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The Energy &amp; Transportation space is more mixed amid continued volatility in oil prices and tightened oil and gas capital spending. In reciprocating engines, we expect our sales into the Permian Basin will strengthen in the fourth quarter as takeaway capacity improves. We expect solar turbines to have a strong fourth quarter as well Progress Rail. Power generation continues to be an area of expected growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Please turn to Slide 5 for a progress update on our strategy for profitable growth. We continue to execute our strategy by investing in services and expanded offerings, while improving operational excellence. We've been working hard to improve product lead-times. Due to the significant increase in volume during the past two and a half years, we struggle to keep up with demand for some products. This was primarily due to ramp-up issues at our suppliers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're pleased that product lead-times have improved even though volume remain strong. We have achieved or are close to achieving target lead-times for the vast majority of our products. In Resource Industries, for example, our current scheduled average lead-time now is just 12 weeks, more than a 50% improvement compared to March of 2018 and we had a weighted average of 26 weeks for the entire portfolio. Shorter lead-times allow customers and dealers more flexibility on when to initiate orders.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also continue to focus on enhancing operational excellence including safety. Our safety goal is always zero incidents. We want our people to return home safely every day. One of the metrics we track is the number of recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked. May and June were two of our best safety months on record. We intend to keep the momentum going and make it a great year for safety. Earlier this year, we announced a goal to double ME&amp;T services sales to $28 billion by 2026. Services increased customer value by improving asset utilization and availability, while reducing owning and operating costs. We continue to invest to expand our digital capabilities enabling services growth and we remain on track toward our goal of one million connected assets by the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Product rebuilds and reap hours are just one of our services helping customers to be more successful. Progress Rail recently won a contract to repower several locomotives for our U.K. rail customer. The new E&amp;P engines will meet EU emission standards and the first three powers is expected to be delivered next year. Repowers and modernizations are both areas as our locomotive customers seek greater utilization of existing fleets.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Many of our meetings with mining customers these days include discussions around technologies like autonomy and automation and how they improve safety and productivity. We have recently been selected for three greenfield projects that will further grow our penetration of autonomy with mining customers in South America and Australia. More than 220 tracks have accumulated 50 million kilometers of autonomous driving in fleets already deployed. Our autonomous solutions are now being utilized by seven customers across 11 sites and three continents. We believe that we are at a tipping point for adoption of autonomy and mining.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For example, this quarter we announced that we will be working with Rio Tinto to create a technologically advanced iron ore mine in Western Australia. We will supply and support mining machines, automation and enterprise technology systems for this project. Working closely with WesTrac, our local dealer, Rio Tinto plans to create an automotive mine operation using data analytics and integration to enhance safety, optimize production, use mining machine utilization and lower costs.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We also continue to expand our offerings, enable us to continue to grow by addressing the diverse needs of our customers around the world. This year we introduced the first Cat-articulated truck GC model the 740 GC. As you may know the GC designation means the machine target segment that we refer to as life cycle value. This segment is for customers who have lighter duty applications or work in less extreme conditions. They value simple, tough machines that perform well with Caterpillar quality and product support. The 740 is particularly attractive in the North American rental market where it offers an additional value proposition in its size class. That said the machine is also gaining traction in every region of the world. Interest in the 740 GC has been strong with year-to-date demand exceeding our initial forecast.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">With that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for a closer look at our financials.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Andrew Bonfield</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with slide 6, I will begin with a closer look of results. Then I'll touch on backlog and dealer inventories before turning to our outlook for the second half and full year. Starting with the headlines. Sales and revenues for the quarter totaled $14.4 billion, up 3% from last year's quarter, driven by Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Overall operating profit increased by 2% or $46 million to $2.213 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Second quarter profit per share was $2.83 was up by $0.01 versus the prior year's record second quarter. There were a number of factors, which impacted the overall performance of the quarter. First, negative mix had an unfavorable impact on profits. This has bolstered the product and the segment length of level. Second, oil and gas sales remained weak as we wait for the Permian takeaway issues to be resolved. We now expect this to occur in the fourth quarter. Finally we booked significant restructuring expenses in the quarter, which means that we expect this spend to be immaterial for the rest of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases in the second quarter and paid $492 million in dividends as part of our commitment to returning substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders. We also announced a 20% increase in the dividend effective from the third quarter, which reflects our confidence in the company's ability to continue to grow cash flows. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity including $7.4 billion of cash on hand.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Let me dive deeper into the top line on slide 7. Consolidated sales growth was 3%, reflecting price realization in ME&amp;T of 3% with gains in the three primary segments. Volumes grew by 2% and the demand environment remain strong. As we reported this morning, machine retail sales to users grew by 4% during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking by segment, construction industry sales and revenues rose 5% led by price realization including the 2019 mid-year increase as well as the increase on the 1st of January. Sales and revenues from Resource Industries increased by 11% fueled by higher equipment demand and favorable price realization. Energy &amp; Transportation sales and revenues declined by 4%, primarily due to continued softness in oil and gas as well as timing challenges and project in locomotive deliveries.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our financial product segment revenue rose 5%. Currency pressures reflected the dollar strengthening principally against euro and Australian dollar. Overall, our top line growth reflected the customers and dealers confidence in the value proposition of our equipment. If you move to slide 8, I will walk through the changes in operating profit. As shown on the chart, price realization and low SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses closed the operating profit increase contributing $427 million and $118 million respectively. Financial Products also added $14 million to operating profits for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Manufacturing cost increased by $328 million, due to higher material costs including $17 million in tariffs, variable rate on burden including the loss of Brazilian incentives and warranty expense. Unfavorable sales volumes about $190 million, primarily due to mix changes in both Construction Industries and Energy &amp; Transportation. In Construction Industries, the mix of sales reflected an increase in smaller products in North America. The mix in ME&amp;T reflects the changes in the application mix including smaller engines. Importantly, price realization more than covered higher manufacturing cost this quarter an improvement versus Q1. We also continue to expect price realization to fully cover higher manufacturing cost for the full year. It's now been a year since tariffs were implemented, and input prices are moderating. Freight costs have also stabilized. Currency lowered sales by two percentage points and reduced operating profit by about $20 million.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving down the P&amp;L. Lower short-term incentive compensation expense impacted SG&amp;A and R&amp;D favorably, while also benefiting manufacturing costs. We expect 2019 short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $600 million lower than in 2018. Before taking a look at the segment results, I want to comment on how the second quarter trended against our first quarter performance.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Second quarter sales rose versus the first quarter driven by seasonal trends higher North American construction industry sales, sales of original equipment in Resource Industries, and higher rail service revenue. From an operating profit perspective, the second quarter was about flat compared to the first quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The favorable sales performance was offset by negative mix and a negative operating leverage due to lower absorption cost into inventories driven by the reduction in production levels as we reduce Caterpillar inventories. The operating profit margin contracted by 110 basis points. From a segment perspective, the sequential margin deterioration was highest in Resource Industries which as you know had a very strong first quarter. The change in Resource Industries operating margin is due to unfavorable operating leverage from inventory changes coupled with higher warranty expenses.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">To keep it in perspective Resource Industries in the first and second quarters had the highest profit margins since 2012, a year when sales were twice as high as they are now. Year-to-date restructuring charges are $158 million. We don't expect these to recur at these levels in the second half. We still expect the maximum of $200 million of restructuring expenses for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now let's look at the performance of each segment in the second quarter versus the prior year beginning with Construction Industries on slide 9. Construction Industries had a record quarter for both sales and profit. Sales from revenues totaled $6.5 billion again a 5% versus the prior year. Construction sales increase in North America by $774 million due to demand changes including dealer inventories and price realization. Sales were flat in the Latin America where construction remained at low levels. Declines in Asia-Pacific reflected continued aggressive competitive pricing the timing of the selling season as well as unfavorable currency index. Weakness in EAME was primarily due to a weaker euro.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Construction industry's profit increased by $93 million or 8% to a record $1.247 billion, the segment profit margin of 19.3% increased by 60 basis points. The favorable impact of higher volume and price realization was mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs plus unfavorable mix. Now let's go to slide 10 and look at Resource Industries. Resource Industries sales were $2.8 billion up 11% from the second quarter of 2018. The $274 million sales uplift reflects increases in demand and favorable price realization. Sales growth in Resource Industries was driven by strong mining market nonresidential construction and quarry and aggregate customers.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Segment profit of $481 million rose 17%. Resource Industries profit margin improved to 17.2% up 90 basis points. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Growth in original equipment remain strong as miners look to replace aging equipment. If you turn to slide 11, Energy &amp; Transportation sales in the second quarter were $5.5 billion down 4%. Power generation sites increased by 3% on continued demand to large piece or reciprocating engines. The other applications were lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impact.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Of note sales into oil and gas applications decreased by $162 million or 11% due to the timing of turbine project deliveries in North America in last year's quarter, lower demand from new equipment in the Permian Basin -- which were partly offset by higher turbine sales and production applications in EAME. Industrial sales declined by 1% with gains in most regions, more than offset by currency-related impacts in the EAME. Transportation sales declined by 3%, primarily due to the timing of locomotive deliveries and reduced marine activity in North America, partially offset by higher sales trough rail services.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Segment profit for Energy &amp; Transportation totaled $886 million, down $126 million, or 12%. The segment profit margin contracted by 150 basis points to 16.2%. Energy &amp; Transportation margins reflected lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products and slightly higher manufacturing cost, partially offset by price realization. Turning to slide 12. Let me touch on dealer inventories and backlog, which play into our assumptions for the year. Dealer machines and engine inventories increased by about $500 million during the second quarter compared with an increase of about $100 million during the second quarter of 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The largest impact was in Construction Industries, where dealers decreased inventory in the prior year's period. We previously have projected that total dealer inventories would be about flat to the full year. Based on current inventory levels, we now expect that dealer inventories will increase for the full year by about $900 million, driven by Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Whilst dealer inventory levels are closer to the top end of our range, at this time we are comfortable that this level is supported by positive end-user demand.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">At the end of the second quarter of 2019, the order backlog was $15 billion, about $1.9 billion lower than the first quarter of 2019 and down $2.7 billion from the balance at the end of the second quarter of 2018. The order backlog decreased across three -- all three primary segments with the largest declines in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. In Construction Industries, we connect the backlog to client to slowing orders due to growth in dealer inventory. Also, keep in mind, the Construction Industries had a record quarter and it's not unusual for backlog to decline in CI in the second quarter itself.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In Resource Industries, we improved throughput in factories and improved lead times, as Jim has described. And remember, orders do tend to lumpy. As a point of reference, the total decline in the backlog of $2.7 billion since Q2 last year is about offset by the increase in dealer inventories for the same time period.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now let's walk through our assumptions for the 2019 outlook. We now expect profit per share to be near the low end of our range of $12.06 to $13.06, assuming a recovery in oil and gas near the end of the year and dealers working through part of the higher machine inventory levels. Quotation activities unchanged, the assumed price realization offsets manufacturing costs and as I've said, restructuring costs for the remainder of the year will be significantly lower with the maximum spend of $200 million.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Other key assumptions are broadly unchanged, including $250 million to $350 million in tariffs for the year. We expect short-term incentive compensation to be a tailwind of about $600 million. We now project capital expenditures of about $1.3 billion. The estimated annual tax rate is unchanged at 26%, excluding discrete tax items. Consistent with our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders, we are now projecting share repurchases in the second half to be similar to the first half. In fact including all shares repurchased since the 1st of January, 2019, we expect to reduce our total shares outstanding by about 9% by the end of 2019, all the while executing our strategy and investing for long-term profitable growth. This reduction in share count is fully reflected in our guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Looking ahead to the third quarter we will continue to execute our strategy including making appropriate additional investments for longer term profitable growth. We anticipate stronger results in the fourth quarter including increases in demand from oil and gas and rail customers. So, finally, let's turn to Slide 13 and recap today's key takeaways. We grew sales 3%, operating profit rose 2%, profit per share was comparable with the second quarter of last year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We have maintained our profit per share outlook, although we expect it to be at the lower end of the range of $12.06 to $13.06. Again this adjustment reflects mix changes, a fourth quarter recovery in oil and gas, and dealers working through higher machine inventory levels, partially offset by lower restructuring charges in the second half of the year. We still expect modest sales growth this year and profit growth on top of last year's record results. We are also on track including 2019 buybacks to retire a total about 9% of our shares outstanding by the 31st of December and our financial position remain strong.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, let me hand it back to Jennifer to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Catherine, thank you. If you could now queue up the questions.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Rob Wertheimer from Millennium Capital. Sir, your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Wertheimer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you, and good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Driscoll</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning, Rob.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Wertheimer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">So, thanks for the color on the dealer inventory. I think that will be something investors want to talk about. I wanted to ask for just a little bit more clarity around it. I mean obviously you don't control what the dealers do and it's their own decisions. But do you have a sense of what led to the change of the building a little bit of inventory through the year versus the prior expectation? It doesn't seem like sales have inflected up sharply since then.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And then just wrap my follow-up into it. I mean is the $900 million gap between what you thought and what sounds like it will be, is that the difference between your ideal level and where it may end versus the downtime risk for ongoing? Or maybe if you just characterize how big that gap is versus ideal? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey Rob, it's Jim, I'll take the first part of that question and maybe ask Andrew to do the second part. So, as you mentioned dealers are independent businesses and they control their own inventory levels. Inventory levels were lower than they normally are and with that increase, we're back up to what is considered more of a normal level.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I did talk about the fact that we had -- we have been successful in reducing our product lead times which also has an impact here as well. So, that gives dealers a lot more flexibility in terms of where they place orders. Andrew I'll let you have the second.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">On the $900 million reduction, we expect for the remainder of the year, reduction to about $900 million. I mean we are slightly at the high end; we'd like to be in the middle of the range. We keep a range for each segment. We're always comfortable being at sort of midpoint in the range. This gets us around about the midpoint from our perspective, Rob. So there would be potentially further reduction, but we were very low in that range previously. And as Jim indicated they did have some impact on availability. Ultimately at the end of the day, we want to make sure that dealers have the right amount of inventory to be able to meet customer demand and probably there was given that the challenges we've had previously there may have been some loss of sales at dealer level as a result of not being under supply quickly enough.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Wertheimer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. I beg your pardon. So with the -- I guess reduction from here to the end of the year, you're saying you're going to be roughly in the middle of the range not certainly low of where you'd like to be? Is that what you're saying?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah, that would characterize it. Yes, Rob.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Rob Wertheimer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Your next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the mix issues in the second quarter, how much that hurt earnings and what's implied for the back part of the year. And then just within oil and gas specifically I think before you said you had expected orders to pick up in the back part of the year in the second half now you're seeing the first -- fourth quarter. I guess just, sort of, what gives you confidence that you should see that acceleration? And how much cushion could we potentially get from solar in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Good morning Jamie, it's Jim. So our oil and gas guidance for the year is dependent on certainly solar having a strong fourth quarter. Solar has as you know the lead times are relatively long. They have the orders in hand to -- for the new equipment side to execute that. There's always some variability in service, but we are expecting a big fourth quarter from Solar and fully expect them to make that happen. We are also expecting in the fourth quarter some recovery in recip engine sales in North America as the Permian constraint issues continue to be resolved.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Jamie on the mix issues, obviously, the mix did have quite an impact in the quarter. If you look at we saw a small increase in volume, the sales level but a negative move in the operating profit level. Principally in CI that was mostly due to the fact that we also sold more small machines in the quarter while they have similar margins that can be quite sensitive to be able to mix impact.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And then, obviously, there's also a segmental mix and those mixed within E&amp;T similar mix issue in E&amp;T particularly with low smaller engines being sold. And then also there's a segmental mix impact, obviously, because E&amp;T does have very strong margins and obviously the margin deterioration impacted the reported mix as we look at variable margin in that business.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">All of those factors have been built into our guidance, so we have put that into why we expect to be at the low end of the range along with a delay particularly in oil and gas sales.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay, thank you. I’ll get back in queue.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Your next question is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">David Raso</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, good morning. I'm trying to think through the second half implied guidance. Just so we set the framework. It looks like you're implying revenues down say about $500 million first half to second half. But the EPS grows about $0.25 to $0.50. And I'm just trying to understand I can see about $0.15 from lower restructuring sequentially. It maybe about $0.05 from a lower share count so it's about $0.20. But then I would have figured rest would have been you see better price cost second half than first half, more than offsetting some overhead absorption issues with the lower volume. But I thought earlier you made a comment price cost maybe I missed it. So it's sort of neutral the rest of the year. Can you clarify that? Just trying to get the EPS walk first half to second half.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yeah. Thanks, David. And – yeah, so first of all, we don't give sales guidance, so your assumption around sales maybe slightly different from our assumptions. So that may have been part of the impact that we're seeing. As Jim indicated, we do expect both rail and solar and oil and gas to pick up in the fourth quarter. All of those will have an impact and remember that obviously E&amp;T is down for the first half of the year, when you look at that. So as you think about it from a top line perspective, there maybe some variability, we see versus where you are on your top line.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">With regards to margins and operating margins obviously there are seasonal factors that come into play. As we did indicate, we're all starting to see a little bit of relief from pricing – from underlying manufacturing cost increases. Obviously, the tariffs we saw – start now anniversary-ing freight costs, started to pick up in the second quarter of last year. So those factors will have less of an impact on overall manufacturing cost. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Offset against a little bit will be some variability, if we do actually take down some production. Obviously, we'll have a little bit lower inventory absorption. So those are all factors, which we weighed into our guidance. Then, obviously, we are starting to see some things like steel cost come down, steel obviously we do a lot of our steel buying on a contractual basis, and there is a lag, but we're all starting to see some of those things flow through as well into the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">David Raso</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then trying to set-up the look into 2020. We've already discussed the inventory but for the backlog. Seasonally, you can see how CI might continue to go down. But when you think about your commentary, the rest of the year on mining and engines E&amp;T are we making the assumption into the backlog is somewhat bottoming out here, because RI and E&amp;T offset CI sequentially? We're just trying to sort get a baseline kind of exiting the year. Have we seen generally speaking the bottom of the backlogs with this $15 billion?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yeah. I mean, I think David one of the problems with focusing very much on the backlog is remind you that this is reflected about dealer demand. There would have been some elements of as a result of an ability to delays in supplying orders availability of product that dealers may actually have been putting slots in the queue and we have seen that happen before and that may have happened this time as well.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Obviously, what does happen with the order backlog is it is lumpy, particularly in places like RI, rail, solar. So we are keeping an eye on it. There's nothing indicating that from a retail, if you look at the retail stats just remind you they are up again. So there's nothing indicating underlying customer demand is changing. This maybe behavior by dealers and their ordering patterns as well.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And, again, just to expand upon how you think about the lumpiness in Solar and Rail. Obviously, if you have a big fourth quarter, there is a lot of shipments that were in the backlog, obviously the backlog will go down. Again, that's – it happens every year that's the nature of the beast.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Raso</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. I'm sorry, Jim. So a part of the $15 billion, you would argue is reflective of why you're confident in the fourth quarter shipments of those businesses, but at the same time it could help the backlog down from here there aren't new orders to fill it in so to speak? </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. And certainly and again that happens every year. So -- I say every year typically, Solar in particular has a big fourth quarter, so we would expect again shipments occur, backlog goes down. But again the business continues to be healthy and good quotation activity. So we would expect that there'll be a normal seasonal pattern in Solar in terms of backlog and inventory. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Raso</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Terrific, thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey good morning, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning, Ross.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on the three new Greenfield sites for autonomous, you know the timing there. Are these retrofits or new trucks and equipment? And is that a positive driver into 2020? Or is it much further out? </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes, it's a multiyear. We're going to make deliveries over a number of years and so they are new trucks. Again these are Greenfield sites. So again a lot of new technology, but the deliveries will occur not just in one year, it'll be over more than one year. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your confidence in the China excavator outlook for the second half of 2019? I mean, it sounds like your full year outlook is broadly unchanged and as you’ve cited there is some competitive pressure there. I mean, how much visibility do you have on that business for the rest of 2019?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Based on everything that we see, we believe that overall the market demand will be stable. We have mentioned the fact that we have some competitor pricing pressures from local competitors. We're certainly taking steps to ensure our competitiveness long term in China. We're introducing a number of new GC products that will help us compete as well. But again we are -- we feel good about our forecast there in China. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then just lastly Andrew, you mentioned your share count should be down 9% by the end of this year with the buybacks. Beyond 2019, if you did 4 billion to 5 billion in buybacks, I think that will retire about 6% of the share count at today's price.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I was just wondering how much of that 6% is fair to assume for -- is offset by share issuance for employees options et-cetera. Just net of equity issuance, I'm just trying to get a better sense for how much the share count should be falling each year beyond this year?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. So obviously the 9% -- around 9% is a net number. So that's niche of new issuance. So effectively given that we'd spend 3.8 last year, we expect somewhat to be in the sort of at least the 2.1 in the first quarter -- first half something similar in the second half. If you're doing about 4, you generally retire about 4.5% of the share capital each year.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. So share count just sort of this base case assumption at the current stock prices is probably falling 4% to 5% a year beyond 2019?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey guys, how is it going?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good. How are you?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So just -- it sounds like some pieces you're setting up 2020 to be a little bit more of a difficult year with the incentive comp down, so much this year and the dealer inventory is up a little more. Can you give us some of the pieces that to kind of balance that out? What would be on the other side of that? I'm not asking for forecast just kind of a couple of factors -- bigger factors to think about.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I mean let's remember that we have had quite a tough year in E&amp;T so far. Obviously, Permian takeaway issues are resolved and drilling activity goes up that would be one area where we'd see some upside in 2020. I think if you look also at underlying demand for machines, it remains strong. So, again that's other opportunities for us as we move into 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We will always retain our focus on a flexible and competitive cost structure. We want to invest in the right things for the business to drive long-term profitable growth but we still always do need to make sure that we are operating as efficiently as possible and those are other areas where we will continue to see some opportunity to drive growth as we move forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">That's great. And then my second question is about something you mentioned there too. The cost reductions like it's you guys have done a lot a lot of work there. And it seems like the cost structure is seemingly not as responsive to the fluctuations like quarterly fluctuations in the business. Is that more structural? Or is it cyclical just your kind of scrambling to get stuff out the door? Or can you give us any color behind the scenes of what to think about? Or are those kind of more long-term changes to the company and we can't worry about the near-term results?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I think we don't respond to quarterly -- by quarter movements we're trying to drive the business for the long-term. So, Joel as we look at the cost structure we do try to make sure we got a long-term focus on that and don't do things just for short term cost-cutting measures. We can all do those. We've all seen people do those. Longer term it's not what drives you well because what tends to happen is investment then gets cut off which isn't the right thing to do for long-term shareholder value creation.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">But I would say that Joe we certainly challenge all of our leaders to find ways to become more efficient to reduce cost. So, we still believe we have opportunities over next few years to continue to improve our cost structure. So, again, while -- as Andrew mentioned while continuing to invest in those areas particularly like services like our digital capabilities to drive long-term profitable growth.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And so Joel just add one thing on 2020 which I did forget was about Resource Industries. I mean obviously mining we are only in the start of recovery phase and replacement cycle. There is a lot of potential still but there is to run as miners start actually bumping up CapEx. All commodities remain at investable levels so we do expect that to continue to improve as we look out as well.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">That's awesome. Thank you so much.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Driscoll</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">You're welcome.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Your next question is coming from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa Capital. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jairam Nathan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi thanks for taking my question. My question was regarding rail. You mentioned a strong 4Q, but you're seeing some of the implementation of PSR on the railroad side, they are cutting down a number of locomotives they use. And at the same time volumes are starting to decline as well rail volumes. So, I'm just wondering is this expectation of the U.S. or more international?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, it's really based overall on the backlog that we have in rail for new locomotives. But certainly I mentioned earlier the one example we gave of repower. As our rail business is a direct business and there's a large service element to it as well. So, it is not completely dependent upon new locomotives sales.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Having said that, of course, we are expanding internationally. We've shipped our first transit locomotives since we made the acquisition of EMD a number of years ago. So again we are not totally dependent upon new locomotives in North America. We certainly understand the environment, in which we're operating. But again what we're not talking about is an expected strong fourth quarter based on backlog on hand for the rail.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jairam Nathan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks. And my last question was on margins on resource, you mentioned warranty expense increased. Can you expand on that? Is that more volume related? Or is there something…?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">It was a particular issue with a particular product that happened, these things do happen they do tend to be lumpy and that's been a driver in this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jairam Nathan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay, thank you. That’s all I had.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question is coming from Sameer Rathod from Macquarie Research. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Sameer Rathod</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you for taking my question. There are some -- have been some interesting developments made in electrifying the frack. So my question is how does Caterpillar see this market evolving? Do you think it can post a risk longer term to the diesel engine and parts business? Or do you think the applications are limited? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I'm sorry, I can barely hear you. Did you say electrification and fracking? Is that the question?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Sameer Rathod</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Electrification and fracking.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">You bet. So we have been very involved working with customers both on the recip engine side and on the gas turbine side and what people called the e-fracking opportunity. So we are well-positioned to participate in both of those areas.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We have sold some gas turbines, which are generator sets that allow customers to do e-fracking. We're also working on recip solutions as well, working with customers. So I believe it will be a mix market with both and we'll see, which one is stronger in the end but we participate in both ways, both for electrification and now also both in our recip engines and with gas turbines. So we're well-positioned to play directly across the value chain.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Sameer Rathod</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes hi, good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning, Jerry.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">You folks have sounded more positive tone on large mining truck order cadence than I think we've heard from you in a while. Can you just talk about what in your view has driven a slower replacement cycle in this recovery so far? Is it the autonomous decisions that have to be made? And can you just expand a bit more Andrew on your comments that there's a scope for move towards replacement as you think about moving pieces around2020? So it does sound like you expect order decisions to be made, obviously, in advance of 2020 for that to play out. So maybe I can get you to expand on that too?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, Jerry this is Jim. I'll take it. So we see strong quotation activity on a global basis for all commodities. So as we work directly with our customers and with our dealers there is increasing quotation activity. There's a lot of projects that are being developed. We've talked about some orders that we received. Certainly I believe and I actually hope there’ll be less volatility than will be -- that there has been in the past it will be more of a slow steady ramp up. But the quotation activity is quite strong. And again it's across all commodities.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And just to add, I mean the pulp feed is at an all-time low since we've been tracking that number in 2013. So, it is an opportunity. Definitely, we do believe that now we will be starting to see replacements solvency come through.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And we do expect our mining customers to be disciplined in their capital expenditures. So, again, that ties into my earlier comment about more of a slow steady increase than a volatile increase. And they will be again cautious and disciplined. But we expect the business to continue to improve on a slow and steady basis.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. And in Construction Industries, you folks have worked really hard to get the cost structure to where it is today. Given the dealer inventory builds both across new equipment, used equipment and the utilization pressures, I guess, can you talk about what's the potential for you folks to more actively manage orders. You mentioned there are some slots that are potentially placeholders et cetera, so what's the opportunity for you folks to get ahead of the eventual order declines given what some of the leading indicators are doing, cut production earlier to keep the swings from being really painful on the manufacturing base.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. Just to be clear, so firstly, let me start with the -- we released our retail stats this morning. And so, business is improving. So let's start with that. But certainly shortened lead times is very important. We've been on this for lean journey for a long time and having shorter lead times allows us to respond much more quickly to changes in demand.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Andrew, the count was I guess more focus on North America than overall. So the retail sales were up 7%, the company sales were up 28%, so we're building inventories in North America specifically. So, I'm wondering what the potential to get on in front and cut production early in the cycle?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. So we did -- so Jerry part of -- as we -- as I spoke in my comments, we did see some takedown of Caterpillar inventory, finished goods inventory, so we do continue to focus on that. Obviously with lean manufacturing, we are obviously -- we don't hold a lot of finished goods inventory. Most of the inventories held actually in the component levels are actually both in. So actually that is the one thing we continue to focus on. But obviously, we will look at making sure that we don't -- as we said, we will take down dealer inventory in the second half and then we'll have some impact on production base.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Driscoll</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">You’re welcome. Next question please?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question is coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi, good morning. If I could turn back to oil and gas, I'd like to really understand your confidence in the fourth quarter pickup in sales. Is this products that dealers have ordered? So it's shipments to dealers? Or is it the rail end-market demand? And if you could just talk about your mix in oil and gas well completion versus drilling, so we know which one is more important to demand for your products. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Ann, so good morning. Again starting -- part of the oil and gas pickup as I mentioned earlier is due to Solar where we have the backlog and the orders on hand. It's a matter of executing always some variability in service, but we feel good about that. So that is part of it. If you go to the Recip side of it, gas compression remains strong. We are expecting an increase in end-user demand for fracking that will impact our business towards the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And on the fracking side, is that actually drilling or is that well completions? I'm trying to understand if this one's right or if there's more.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It's mostly well service.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up question is more, if you look back at year-to-date performance, sales are up but in fact adjusted net income is down. So Jim, should we be growing concerns, should investors be growing concerned about your commitment to profitable growth? I mean, I know you can say you're at record levels, but net income is actually down and just the basis year-to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. So we are so very committed to profitably growing our business and we're making investments to make that happen. And we are -- we talked about this at Investor Day as well that we do expect quarterly variability in our performance, but we are very much focused on improving year to year. We've talked in our call this morning about some of the issues we had in terms of lumpiness in restructuring charges and we had some inventory impact. We do have some mixed impact and we will have just given the nature of our business, we will have quarterly deviations in our performance. But we're really driving for is medium and long-term profitable growth and we're investing to make that happen. We're committed to take on -- to continue to improve our cost structure structurally. I talked about that earlier and we believe we have opportunities there over the next few years to take that on and we're very committed to that profitable growth story. But again, we will have quarterly deviations. There's no question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And yes, but if I look at six of the last seven quarters your stock has underperformed. So, is there something you can do structurally going forward to help us understand this variability?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. Again, what we're driving towards is profitably growing our company. And if we profitably grow our company, I believe that will be reflected in the stock price. And we're going to have -- again as we talked earlier, we expect to have another record year in earnings per share this year. It’s another record year.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question is coming from Timothy Thein from Citigroup. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Timothy Thein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you and good morning. The first question is on RI and specifically, Andrew, you had mentioned earlier that OE was a big driver or a driver for growth in the quarter. So, I'm not sure exactly what that means for part sales. But really the question relates to the sustainability of pricing which was up against some pretty tough comp again in the second quarter. And just, as you see basically the question is the trade-off on as your OE volumes presumably capture a bigger part of the total within mining, how should we expect that trade-off to play out in terms of pricing on OE relative to parts?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. So obviously, we did have -- in the first quarter, actually, we had really strong quarter. I think it was a record quarter for part sales within Resource Industries and part of that was driven by the fact obviously, its rebuilds are still continuing. Yes, there will be a mixed impact. It depends on what equipment we’re selling and the relative mix of parts versus and services versus OE. That will be part of why -- how we manage that business. Obviously, the advantage we have on OE is as you improve throughput, you do improve operating leverage.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And as I say, we actually have seen these two quarters, the first and the second quarter have been the two best quarters in our eyes since 2012 when actually sales revenues were nearly doubled what they are today. So I think we will see lumpiness, we will see movement that's the nature of that business particularly given the way we actually deliver our products to customers, but we're quite comfortable with the sort of the relative margin performance. And again, we will look at them over time rather than just purely quarter-to-quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Timothy Thein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Got it. And then Jim maybe one last one on oil and gas, and specifically your comments to the question recently just on well servicing. A number of the big service companies have commented just in the past few days about cutting CapEx budgets some of them pretty significantly. So I'm just – I just want to come back in terms of kind of what's underlying that assumption that we do get this pickup of recovery in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah, again it's our perception of what's going to happen as the takeaway issue in the Permian are resolved. So I'll leave it there. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Timothy Thein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">All right. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Umpleby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And thank you. I think we have time for one last question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your last question is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. First on restructuring, can you just help us understand I think the first quarter you said was pretty minimal? So how much of that $158 million was hitting this quarter? And in which segments it was showing up? And then if you could also quantify the warranty charge that was in resources. And then just more broadly when we think about your China business with APAC sales down as much as they were this quarter in construction. How should we be thinking about the margin for that business as you're continuing to introduce these GC products relative to what you had been getting in light of all these competitive pricing pressures?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. Courtney, maybe start with restructuring. The charge in the first quarter was $48 million and the second quarter was $110 million. The $48 million is inactive, so you can now always refer back to that. Most of it actually was incurred and is held within the corporate item. There is some move back into the business but very limited and very small not materially impacting their reported margins. With regards to warranty expense, we don't actually break down the analysis and manufacturing cost, but the fact we’re calling out to shows it was a significant item in the quarter. But obviously, and it did have an impact on the overall performance in RI in the comparison in Q1 versus Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">China new products? </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Bonfield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yeah, sorry. On China new products, obviously GC products are in lower price point, but had similar margins as we said before. So overall this shouldn't impact reported margins as much. Obviously, the most important thing is making sure we retain a good competitive position. This quarter was impacted in part – the reported revenues were impacted part by timing of the Chinese New Year. We did see the benefit of that in Q1, which did have a negative impact in Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And with that, we'll turn it back to Jim.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Jim Umpleby</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Well, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Just a few closing comments. We view our competitive position is very strong. We're continuing to invest to achieve our strategy of a long-term profitable growth including doubling services sales in ME&amp;T by 2026. We had – we expect record profits this year, our second consecutive record from an EPS perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And as we talked about we continue to generate strong cash flow, which underpins our commitment to return substantially all free cash to shareholders through our buybacks and dividends. And as Andrew talked about if you take new account 2018 and 2019 by the end of the year, we expect to have a 9% share count reduction by the year -- by the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">With that, I, thank you, for your questions and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you, Jim and thanks everyone who joined us today. We appreciate your interest in Caterpillar. If you have any questions please reach out to me or Rob Rengel in IR and e-mail at driscoll_jennifer@cat.com or rengel_rob@cat.com. And now let me ask Catherine to conclude our call. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.</p>]"

Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Wayne Borduin</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for investors and stockholders on slide 2.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Turning to slide 3. And Pierre? </p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Pierre Breber</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Wayne. We had another solid quarter. The company delivered record production, led by continued strength in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia. Jay will provide more detail shortly.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $4.3 billion or $2.27 per share. This is the highest reported quarterly result since the third quarter 2014 when Brent was over $100 a barrel. The quarter's results include special lighting gains, totaling $920 million from the Anadarko termination fee and a tax rate change in Alberta. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $15 million. Excluding special items and FX gains earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.77 per share.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from operations was almost $8 billion excluding working capital changes. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Importantly our continued strong cash flow allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends. And after terminating our agreement with Anadarko, we resumed buybacks and repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter. Going forward we expect share buybacks at the $5 billion annual run rate or $1.25 billion per quarter, in line with our updated guidance stated in May.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We also continued to maintain capital discipline with a focus on increasing returns. Year-to-date organic CapEx was $9.6 billion, a little less than half of our $20 billion budget. Total CapEx, which includes acquisition costs that are unbudgeted such as the purchase of the Pasadena refinery, totaled $10 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Turning to slide 4. Cash flow was strong and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Cash flow from operations excluding working capital increased this quarter due to growing production volumes and higher liquids realizations as well as the termination fee received from Anadarko.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Free cash flow, excluding working capital increased to $4.3 billion and supported the dividend, debt reduction and share buybacks. The company's cash flow breakeven remains in the low 50s on a Brent basis year-to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Asset sale proceeds added to our cash flow and further lowered the breakeven while high-grading our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $2.9 billion and we remain on track to divest $5 billion to $10 billion of assets by 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Slide 5, second quarter 2019 earnings of $4.3 billion increased about $900 million versus the prior year. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was offset by lower realizations. Downstream earnings also were relatively flat as timing effects were offset by lower margins. The variance in the other segment was primarily the result of lower corporate charges.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Slide 6, compared to the first quarter, second quarter earnings increased by about $1.7 billion. Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were roughly flat as higher liftings in crude realizations were offset by lower gas realizations, higher DD&amp;A, and other expenses.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Australia gas realizations were lower primarily due to lower LNG spot prices and a higher ratio of spot LNG sales, while U.S. gas realizations reflected weaker Henry Hub and Waha pricing. Downstream earnings excluding FX improved by about $520 million due to stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins and timing effects, partly offset by the impact of planned downtime. The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I'll now pass it to Jay.</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Jay Johnson</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thanks Pierre. On Slide 7, second quarter oil equivalent production increased 9% compared to a year ago with shale and tight production increasing in the Delaware and Midland Basin and production from major capital projects increasing with ramp-ups at Wheatstone, Hebron, and Big Foot. Our base business production increased as Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater brownfield developments more than offset natural declines across the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Slide 8, second quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the third straight quarter. Year-to-date production excluding asset sales is about 5% higher than 2018 consistent with our guidance of 4% to 7% growth as shown by the middle bar.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Second quarter production was impacted by planned turnarounds and asset sales which together had an impact of almost 70,000 barrels a day. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Big Foot and Hebron. This growth will be partially offset by higher turnaround activity in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is expected to be in line with this guidance even before adjusting for the entitlement impacts of higher prices.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Let's turn to the Permian. In the next three slides, I'll provide some additional information regarding the attractive performance and the potential of this asset. Permian shale and tight production continues to track the guidance we provided at our 2019 Security Analyst Meeting. In the second quarter, production was 421,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, an increase of over 150,000 barrels a day, or about 55% relative to the same quarter last year. The strong performance demonstrates our track record of consistent execution and we expect to deliver 900,000 barrels per day in 2023 with a relatively steady rig count.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Moving to the mix of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas about three-quarters of our Permian production is liquids and half of our production is crude oil. We expect these proportions to continue throughout the forecasted period. As discussed in the past, we have an advantaged royalty position across the Permian, and it's comprised of two distinct components. First, we have a royalty benefit shown on the dotted blue wedge as our actual royalty rate is lower than the standard royalty rate.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The second component comes from the royalty barrels shown by the hashed blue wedge, which are the barrels we received from the acreage that we've leased to other producers. Of course, these barrels require no Chevron capital. In total, these royalty contributions make up about 20% of our production throughout the five-year period and contribute to delivering our expected production profile.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let's turn to slide 10. Our work to reduce unit cost and increase productivity continues. We're optimizing our Permian factory and maintaining our focus on delivering industry-leading returns. This slide shows the progress, we've made since 2016. As shown on the left, we continue to drive higher EURs by optimizing well spacing, landing zones, and completions. The average lateral length of our wells continues to increase and is expected to approach 10,000 feet next year as we execute our core-up strategy for our development areas.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As illustrated in the upper right, these efforts translate into a sustained reduction in unit development and production costs. The chart on the lower right shows that the royalty benefit alone leads to returns that are about 10 percentage points higher than a comparable well subject to the standard royalty burden. As we said before, our strategy in the Permian is to be highly competitive in our execution, leverage our midstream capability and use our advantaged royalty position to make us the clear leader in financial returns.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Slide 11 shows that we're well on our way. As stated in March, we expect to be free cash flow positive next year, and we expect to grow free cash flow each year thereafter. Earnings are expected to strengthen exceeding $4 billion in 2023. All of this assumes the same reference prices communicated at our 2019 Security Analyst Meeting.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As the Permian production increases, we expect to see operational cash flow nearly twice the level of C&amp;E by 2023 and a return on capital employed of about 30% all delivered by an optimized ratable factory with relatively low execution risk.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">To more than double production, while being free cash flow positive, every year starting next year, and generate returns on capital in excess of 20% along the way, shows why this is an attractive investment opportunity for our company and its shareholders. We're focused on value not volume and our true measure of success is building sustainable business with strong free cash flow and growing returns.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let's turn to slide 12. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a robust portfolio that's performing well, generates good value and has attractive investment opportunities at each stage of development. We have a strong queue of exploration prospects that we're actively evaluating and maturing.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Earlier this year, we participated in the Blacktip exploration well, which resulted in the discovery near Perdido and Whale. The well encountered more than 400 feet of net pay and is within tieback distance. Whale and Ballymore are progressing through the appraisal phase to further assess the size of the resource. As mentioned in March, we're targeting unit development cost of $16 to $20 a barrel for new development in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Anchor continues to progress towards FID, which is expected by early next year. The technology we're developing to exploit these higher-pressure reservoirs will allow us to target other resource opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. At Mad Dog 2, drilling and fabrication is progressing as planned and the project is expected to deliver first oil in 2021.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And we expect Big Foot and Stampede to increase production as we bring on additional wells. We're also pursuing highly economic brownfield developments at existing assets such as Jack/St. Malo and Perdido. With our leading technology, experienced workforce and broad portfolio, we're continuing to add value in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to slide 13. I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan again in June and we continue to make good progress with the Future Growth Wellhead Pressure Management project at Tengiz. The project's now 65% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2022. As we discussed at the March analyst meeting, this is another critical year for the project, as we're fully engaged with module fabrication, transportation and installation and that's our first full year of mechanical, electrical and implementation work at site.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Detailed engineering and procurement are almost complete, reducing the risk of further impact on fabrication and construction activities. We're on schedule to close out work at three of the four fabrication yards this year. The logistics system is working well and modules are being delivered, restacked and set on foundations.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As reported in the media on June 29, one of our contractors at the 3GP site experienced an interpersonal conflict that resulted in the suspension of construction activity at the site for several days. Production operations and other FGP sites were not affected by the incident. And overall, the event is expected to have a relatively minor impact on project progress. With respect to construction, we're just under 40% complete. Looking ahead, our focus continues to shift to productivity at site where we're seeing good performance from our workforce and steady improvement in productivity.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, I'll turn it back over to Pierre.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Pierre Breber</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thanks, Jay. Slide 14 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, through our joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, we announced two new petrochemical investments, one in the U.S. Gulf Coast and one in Qatar. Each is in the joint venture with Qatar Petroleum. The long-term fundamentals of chemicals are strong. We believe these projects offer attractive returns underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, world-class scale and leading technology.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Also in the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Denmark and executed an agreement to sell our U.K. Central, North Sea fields which we expect to close later this year. Additionally, we completed our acquisition of the Pasadena refinery which will enable us to supply more of our retail market in the region and process more domestic light oil.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the renewable space, we recently agreed to purchase wind power to supply our Permian operations. This is a cost-effective renewable energy alternative to our current electricity supply in the Permian.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Also Chevron executed an agreement to be an equity partner in CalBioGas, a joint venture to produce end market, dairy biomethane as a vehicle fuel in California. The project will capture methane that otherwise would be vented into the atmosphere and process it into renewable natural gas.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to slide 15. Our performance this quarter reinforces four key messages you've heard from us in the past. First, we have an advantaged portfolio that is delivering today and is positioned to do so over the long-term as Jay highlighted in the Permian Gulf of Mexico and at Tengiz.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Second, with continued positive free cash flow this year we have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, a low cash breakeven and resilience if prices fall. Third, we are disciplined with capital spending on-track with our budget and committed to increasing returns.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And fourth, we had a total cash yield of about 6% with the resumption of our share buybacks. Bottom line we are positioned to deliver superior financial performance to our shareholders consistently for many years to come. Now looking ahead, we continue to expect….</p>, <p class=""p p4"">[Technical Difficulty].</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. The conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on the line. The conference call will resume momentarily.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Checking to see if I can hear our speakers? Hello?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Wayne Borduin</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">We’re here. Thanks, Jonathan.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you. Would you like to take questions at this time?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Wayne Borduin</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">I believe we were cut off prematurely, so actually we'll begin with slide 16. </p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">All right. You may resume.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Pierre Breber</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. This is Pierre and we understand that we cut off at slide 16, so I'm going to resume there and we're going to look ahead. In Upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7%, excluding 2019 asset sales. Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Nigeria and the North West Shelf and Australia as well as the early July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to impact production in the third quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion depending upon price, investment profile, and its dividends. In downstream, we expect high level of refinery turnaround activity in the third quarter which guides to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million. For the third quarter, we expect a repurchase -- we expect to repurchase shares at a rate of $1.2 billion per quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">With that I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Wayne Borduin</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We’ll do our best to get all of your questions answered. Jonathan, please open the lines.</p>, <p class=""p p5"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yes, hi good morning. Can you hear me all right?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Good morning Phil.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yes. So, I guess first question just looking at this Permian additional disclosure and your cash flow expectations, it seems like what you're implying here is that you can grow earnings and cash flow and the ratio of cash flow to CapEx keeps going up. So, it seems to imply pretty flattish CapEx profile, which I think is fairly consistent with the rig count trajectory you talked about at Analyst Day. So, I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of walk through that detail.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And then secondarily with -- related to that I know you recently had an announcement that you made with enterprise talking about takeaway out of the Permian. I was just wondering how that all feeds into this ability to ensure you get the best realizations for your production. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. I'll take it and Pierre may want to add some at the end. From a CapEx standpoint, Phil, we are looking to maintain a relatively flat profile in capital and that's because essentially we're looking to have a very steady rig fleet as we go forward. We have 20 company-operated rigs. Those are basically on a 100% basis because we operate our own licenses.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And then we look for about 30 roughly gross non-operated rigs which equates to about seven to 10 net non-operated rigs. So, as we move that forward, we expect to see capital relatively constant. We're building out infrastructure of course and we always have some exploration activity out in front of us and we also do pilot work to ensure that we are continuing to drive to increase the recovery and efficiency of our developments.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In terms of the takeaway capacity, I'll break it into three different streams. I'll start with the crude oil and basically for 2019, we're well covered on our takeaway capacity for crude oil. In 2020, we are also covered for the year. There may be periods of tightness in length as we move through the year, but we recently executed an agreement with enterprise not only for takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin, but also for export capacity that will lengthen our ability to supply crude not only in the domestic U.S., but internationally.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">When we look at natural gas liquids, we have full takeaway capacity for this year and next year. And as we turn to gas, we really think of gas in two ways. The first is just basic flow assurance. We need to be able to move the gas without having to flare or have any threat of mitigating production in our avoidance of flaring. So we have 100% flow assurance set up for the balance of this year and next year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In terms of takeaway of gas from the basin outward for export, what we look at is this year we're at about 20% of our gas can be exported from the basin. And by the end of this year, we expect to be about 25%. By the end of next year we should be more like 60% of our gas being exported from the basin gives us more exposure to other price structures rather than just the Waha.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks, Phil.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Okay, great. That’s helpful. Just my follow-up question then for Pierre would just be some of your balance sheet commentary. Your net debt-to-cap, I believe is a low sicne it’s been since mid-2015. I know you increased the buyback a bit. There's the situation where you had an M&amp;A considerations there that you walked away from, but I guess how do you think about that level of financial leverage? And where you want to keep that balance sheet for opportunities that might present themselves? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yeah. Well, thanks Phil. Look our cash generation has been strong and we've been returning cash to shareholders and we increased our dividend 6% early this year. As you mentioned we raised our guidance on the share buyback rate in May to $5 billion per year. We're being very disciplined with capital, managing to our $20 billion organic budget in 2019. So the way the math works, no doubt in the short-term, our strong balance sheet gets even stronger. That's okay. Over time this strong cash generation will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained share buyback program.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">That's the way I would think about it. I won't comment on M&amp;A. We, obviously, have -- we're in a very financially strong position, same time we got a great value proposition for our shareholders that we've communicated at our March Analyst Day and then Jay provided more insight into some key elements today and that's what we're focused on delivering.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks, Phil.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning team. I guess, the first question I have Jay, you just came back from Kazakhstan sounds like. There's – there was some questions around labor productivity as it relates to Tengiz. Can you just confirm everything is on track and then just in terms of the capital budget as well your confidence level in achieving the targets that you set out?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. We just did come back in June and we talked about this at the Security Analyst Meeting and in previous calls. A big focus at site now is on labor productivity. We've got a lot of work to do as the modules come in or set on foundations. Last year we're primarily focused on civils and undergrounds. This year we're making the transition to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As we look forward we have to get through commissioning and then all the start-up activities. So we've put in place specific tools that can really help us, not only drive the productivity but understand what the drivers are, where we have gaps, from where expectations are and what we need to do to close those.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Those tools are now widespread across the site and are proving to be very effective, so we've seen steadily improving productivity across the workforce and are actually feeling pretty good about where the execution is headed at this point. But it's early days. We're 40%, roughly complete on construction and we've got a lot of man-hours to go over the next couple of years.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In terms of the overall capital program, you've seen we continue to be right in the middle, right on our guidance. We're about 50% expanded on our Chevron C&amp;E through mid-year and we still expect to maintain our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion for next year, so that should give you a pretty good idea of where things sit.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Appreciate this. And just a follow-up question, this might be for you Pierre. You've gotten a lot of credit from investors for stepping away from the Anadarko potential transaction and showing the capital discipline. Since the deal closed, the stock has materially outperformed other constituents of the XLE or XOP and others, independent E&amp;Ps and that multiple arbitrage or share price ratio arbitrage seems to be opening up again. Just want to get your thoughts on M&amp;A. Again, it felt opportunistic, but is another opportunity potentially opening up here?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah. No. Thanks Neil. Look, I honestly can't speculate on M&amp;A. What I can restate is we have a very strong value proposition for our shareholders. And if I can just -- some of the key elements that we communicated in March is 3% to 4% production growth guidance through 2023, a very disciplined capital program.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Jay provided the 2020 guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion and longer-term guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion from 2021 to 2023. We have leading upstream cash flow margins, leading earnings margins and we're improving cash return on capital employed by more than 3%. So, we clearly do not need to do a deal.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">That said, as you said, we have been opportunistic in the past if we see a good strategic fit at a good price, at a good value. And two recent examples would be the Pasadena refinery and Anadarko. But we've moved on and we're focused on delivering growing earnings and cash flows for our shareholder.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks Pierre.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks, Neil.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi. Your question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Alastair Syme</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about Anchor, which you're hoping to do FID next year? What do you think has to happen to move that forward? Because my understanding is, there are still some quite significant technological challenges. And the follow-up, if you can just talk a little bit, it's just sort of a question, just on the asset sales, that you announced the U.K. asset sales in the quarter. Can you talk about what happens on the decommissioning of liabilities associated with those assets, please? </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah. So with Anchor, we are in the FEED process, so this is doing all the preliminary engineering work prior to the detailed engineering. I would say there are two primary technologies to be developed to support Anchor. And in developing for Anchor, we'll also have these available for other opportunities that we foresee.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">The first is just the high-pressured technology, getting to that 20,000-psi. That's well along and we really -- it really comes down to just thicker seal. We're in the qualification stages and we really don't see that as a major technology shift. It's just a matter of working through the process. And the second is the higher hook loads for deeper wells and this will also support potential developments like Ballymore.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So neither of those do we regard as a particularly challenging technological advance, but an important one to get finished. So we do expect to be on path with Anchor for FID early in the next year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In terms of the North Sea deal, we really don't get into the details of any of our commercial transactions. I can't really comment too much on that, other than to say, as an overall package we're very comfortable with the transaction as its been constructed and are working with the buyer to move it forward to close. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. And I think I can add to Jay's comments that, we're fully in-tune with the importance of embedded obligations and that's carefully considered in terms of the financial strength of the partners or the parties that we transact with. And again we won't be specific as it's commercially sensitive, but its -- as you can imagine the point of negotiation and something that we don't intend to be exposed to over time. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Alastair Syme</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Alastair.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Biraj Borkhataria</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, thanks for taking my question. And apologies, if I miss this on the call but, I have a question on LNG. You mentioned a higher ratio of spot LNG sales in the quarter. Could you just talk through what was driving that? One of your payers has talked about buyers for their contracts not taking their full nominations. I was wondering if that was the issue or there's something else there. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, thanks Biraj. I'll talk first in general because there's an element of -- as we gain in our performance, the facilities are performing very well, reliability is coming up, we have extra production over and above what we had planned and so all that production is going to be exposed to spot prices. And so that's going to be an ongoing thing.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">In the second quarter specifically, we certainly had excellent performance at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And so we had extra production coming from that. But at the same time we also deferred a turnaround, so we had a turnaround scheduled in the second quarter that's been moved to the fourth. So we had extra cargoes there that were exposed to spot.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We do have some downward flex that was exercised by our purchasers in the shoulder months and that occurred in the second quarter. And then finally, there's also an element even in our fixed-term contracts where we had about a 3 to 6 month delay in the oil pricing that they're linked to and so we saw some downward movement in that element.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So together those all really drive the realizations in the second quarter for our LNG. But as I say going forward, we do expect to see increased production as our reliabilities been higher and our overall goal would be to term that up and get closer to what our expected production is as we gain continued confidence in the reliability of the facilities. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Biraj Borkhataria</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">That's great color. And just a quick follow-up. At Gorgon in particular I think in the past you talked about debottlenecking the project to increased capacity buy maybe 10% or 15%. Could you just update us on where we are now and relative to the original nameplate? </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes I don't recall us giving out specific guidance on percentages of increase. Our focus right now is doing a couple of things. First is just getting the reliability increasingly high and we've seen very good reliability. We're still learning these facilities as we continue to operate and we built learnings from some of the shutdowns and turnarounds that we've already accomplished in the future ones.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">As we look forward, what we are looking at is we're collecting the data literally daily as we move through an annual cycle of the ambient conditions as well as the performance of the plan. We look for where the restructuring to keep us from going to the next level of production.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">At this point in time, I'd say we're probably 2% above where we expect it to be on Gorgon production, around 6% above on Wheatstone. But it's an ongoing effort as we move forward to get more out of our existing investments and infrastructure.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks, Biraj.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Biraj Borkhataria</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Rigby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay, thank you. Yeah. The first is the Anadarko transaction during that process, I felt that you indicated that you had capacity and the willingness to deepen your deepwater participation globally and you spoke quite enthusiastically about adding extra LNG to your portfolio, creating a global position et cetera. So as you move forward with new opportunities and when they arise, is -- thematically outside of the U. S. is that where we should expect you to be appearing or looking?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then the second, just very specifically, with the new refinery asset, what are the plans for that now you've got ownership of it? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. Thanks Jon. This is Pierre and I'll start. I said earlier we moved on, but look we’ll go back to Anadarko a little bit here. Look there are several elements of it, the transaction there was the FID in the Permian, there was the FID in the Gulf of Mexico and there was the LNG. And there was the ability to get synergies out of the transaction and do it at an attractive price that we thought was good for their shareholders and good for our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So that -- if you want to get into our thinking we’re -- adding LNG is something that absolutely we are interested in doing. We've got a great position in Australia that Jay just talked about that's generating a lot of cash where we have opportunities to debottleneck and potentially add to that over time. And you'd expect that we are -- we're always working the portfolio and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in and we'll pursue opportunities in that space. That makes sense for the company and our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">In terms of Pasadena, we've had three very clear strategic objectives on it. One was to provide some equity product into our retail network in Texas. The second was to coordinate and optimize feedstocks and other flows between Texas and our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. And the third was to process more domestic light oil and increasingly try to position and retool the refinery a little bit to take more and more Permian oil.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So really, I mean there -- it's very early days, but I'd say everything is on track and aligned with the strategic rationale. So there's been no surprise in terms of those three objectives. We feel we can meet them with the acquisition. We've had some early wins. In fact over the next few months we expect to run up to 30,000 barrels a day of Permian crude oil. That's a little more than we actually had thought at this point in time. Also we know there's work to do as expected on maintenance and reliability of the facility. So everything is on track and we feel good about it but it's early days. Thanks, Jon.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gammel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks very much. Hello guys. I had a couple on the Permian, slide number 10. I guess the first one would be, obviously, some fairly impressive absolute performance in increasing EUR and decreasing development production cost on an absolute basis. I know you do a lot of benchmarking. How would you say stack up against industry in those areas now? </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes it's a good question, Jason. I think the -- we do, do a lot of benchmarking and this continues to be an evolving story. So I would say, we're competitive on these areas. We have a very good understanding particularly in terms of the type curves across the entire basin.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">We have the capability and actually run decline curves across not only our own, but competitors as well so that we understand how our wells are performing and we're actually very comfortable with the overall performance not only in terms of the recoveries, but the economics that we're generating from the execution work.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then when that's coupled up with our ability to use our midstream capability and our royalty position, it's really giving us, I would say leading financial performance overall. So if you went back and look at our Security Analyst Meeting slides, we showed you some of the competitor data.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We also showed you, how our actual type curves are performing relative to our expectations and they're very tightly coupled. So I think we have a good understanding, but we're seeing that continued improvement as we move forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. The only thing I would add to Jay's comments, this is Pierre. You can cherry pick a lot of data out there to position how you look. We've been pretty consistent with what we've shown.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And also we've done a lot, not just general benchmarking, but comparisons to our non-op partners or the operators on our behalf, where we know we have very good apples-to-apples data. So it is an area of focus and we feel we compete very well. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gammel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">That's great. And maybe just – yeah, just a quick follow-up. I noticed the average lateral length that's planned for 2020 is starting to approach 10,000 feet. In the past you've had fairly frequently slides about swapping another positioning to kind of block up your acreage.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And if you're moving towards 10,000 feet, I'm suspecting you're getting a long ways towards doing that, but can you just kind of talk about whether there's further opportunity there?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well as we continue -- in the existing development areas we're getting higher and higher on our average lateral length and approaching that 10,000 foot mark. In the areas that we've transacted, we had about 60,000 acres that we transacted in 2017 and 95,000 acres in 2018. Those enabled -- about 1,900 longer laterals. So it's really helped us in our core-up development areas.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As we continue though to open up new development areas, we're going to continue to have this land activity as we optimize our land positions. So about half of our acreage overall, we consider to be a very highly productive areas and what we want to do is continue to use swap out or swaps and farm-out, sales, acquisitions to continue to core up our development areas.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We try and do that in a timely manner. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we do want to make sure that we're drilling efficiently as we start each area. As we said many times, our focus is on delivering returns not just chasing production or chasing a certain activity level.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gammel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks guys.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Our next question comes in the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, good morning everyone. I was wondering if Jay, I could take advantage, you been on the call just a little bit in terms of the assumptions you made in the Permian on the cash margins, things have obviously deteriorated at no fall of your, you do in terms of NGLs and gas. So if -- how do you see the prognosis there? What assumptions were you making when you were talking about CapEx versus cash flow?</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And I guess kind of the last piece of that question is 900,000 barrels a day at a 3.3, 3.4 in 2023 suggests that your cash margin across the portfolio could move away from this sort of sector within level you've had in the past. I'm just curious if you can offer any thoughts on that. I've got a follow-up please. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, the cash -- the assumptions that we provided that are all given in our Security Analyst Meeting deck, so you can go back and reference those. And what we’re trying to do is, continue to make sure we have the flow assurance as I mentioned earlier on the call, to move gas out to other markets and not have it captured in the immediate basin. Crude oil, we're already well ahead of that. We move our crude outside the basin and we can access and optimize the markets that we're reaching.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">In terms of the cash margin overall, again we've given you that information. We see that is very strong. There's always going to be fluctuations in the markets as there's tightness and length in different locations. But overall, we feel pretty strong about where we’re heading with this as a production base but also the other production we have around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. I understand, it's -- there's a lot of moving parts in that. My follow-up is kind of related and it's historically when oil prices got a lot weaker, you guys talked routinely about what your sustaining capital was in the portfolio. And obviously, that has been reset favorably by the very large LNG projects and those kind of dominate the base -- the base decline and like thereof.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As you move towards, again, this level of funding a significantly larger proportion of your production and a high decline underlying unconventional asset base, what does that do to the sustaining capital versus, I think, you used to talk about like a $13 billion number, how does that evolve as we move towards the five-year plan.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Doug, yeah. This is Pierre and I'll start and ask Jay to add some comments. We've never really talked about sustaining capital. We've given -- we have a $20 billion capital budget this year that we talked about $18 billion to $20 billion dollars guidance next year. And then $19 billion to $22 billion, 2021 to 2023.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So the guidance is pretty clear, it's pretty tight. That results in enterprise that's growing 3% to 4% of production growth through 2023 with leading cash margin. So the prior eight times, we've talked about the base decline, we are investing in the unconventional, as you saw, in the Permian that it's -- the production is more than doubling, while it's being free cash flow every year, starting next year, at returns that are going from 20% to 30%.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So we feel really good about our position. We're not focused on keeping a base flat capital. We're focused on increasing returns. It's resulting in an outcome of higher production. That's translating to higher earnings and cash flow. But the high decline that you referred to is, it's a nature of the business.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">But when we're investing in it, you can see that, we're more than offsetting that decline and we're doing it in a very economic manner. And as we continue to fill out facilities and keep facilities filled over time, the reinvestment is a very attractive use of capital for the shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I might just build on what Pierre said, because he's absolute right. As we have a larger percentage of our overall production constrained by facilities, that means we have the ability to be very stable on our production. And the same in some respects actually applies in the Permian, while any individual well may have a relatively high decline rate, it does approach an asymptotic curve.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">But the facilities we install for each of the development areas, our goal is to keep those full. And one of the advantages of the Permian is that, in the initial drilling we fill the facilities up, but then we can go back through infill drilling programs and by going after the subsequent benches in a given development area, and just continue to keep those facilities full, and the amount of rig activity it takes is much less for those subsequent drilling campaigns to maintain that production in a given development area. So I actually feel pretty good about where the whole portfolio has moved and really I'm not too worried about what some people see as a problem with these individual Permian wells.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">It’s a great answer guys. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Doug…</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Morning Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Let me just dive in here. Kind of following-up on some of the Permian questions, with your royalty position and others developments and with some of the problems we're seeing from some of those E&amp;Ps, any risk to your outlook from those who might have overstepped their bounds in terms of the way they were developing the Permian?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Well, Roger this is Pierre. I mean, you're right. I mean we don't control the royalty barrels because that's being operated by others who own the working interests we're landowner and as Jay said, we receive those barrels with no capital, no operating costs. But the flipside is that if we don't control the development, so we're doing it based on an outlook and an expectation, it certainly we know what the actual had been. But you're right that there is some risk of that. It could go either way. It could go bigger or lower than what we're showing dependent on what those operator's activity levels are.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay, great. And then from a guidance standpoint on the downstream, the hiring refinery turnaround activity, and for the third quarter I was under the impression you'd had fairly high turnaround activity earlier in the first half of this year. So I was just curious was that the right interpretation, and maybe if there's any geographic specific exposure on the high TARs at this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah Roger, so we have now adopted a practice of giving a pretty clear guidance on planned turnaround activity in the downstream and we characterize it as either a low, medium or high.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So you're right. Second quarter was high. And that's related to $200 million of after tax, earnings impacts both from higher cost and from lost profit opportunity if the volume is not produced. First quarter was actually low, which is up to $100 million of effects. So in the third quarter with another high quarter that's not unusual, it just depends on how the planned turnarounds are set up. We won't provide specifics on the locations. It's commercially sensitive. And so it's just something that we won't do ahead of time, we're happy to talk about it.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Looking backs on the second quarter, we had some planned turnaround activity in Pascagoula and in Asia. So we can explain afterwards, but we think we're giving pretty clear guidance. So you're right that you should view the earnings -- after tax earnings impact of planned turnarounds in 3Q to be the same or similar to 2Q.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Pierre, I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Howard Weil. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi good morning. Jay, since you are here and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the incident in Tengiz with your contractor at least in the media, it seems to me that there's never been more serious talking about -- a between the foreign contractor and the local people and may even be different agenda. Can you give us little bit more update on that and what -- does any initiative had been taken trying to resolve the problem there?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, Paul, I can give you a little bit more. We -- this is really centered around one particular contractor that was at the 3GP site and there was obviously some disagreements between some of their workers and the management of that company. When the issue happened, we shut down the entire site -- the 3GP site, not the other site that didn't have any impact on production operation, but we wanted to make sure that the problem was mitigated and contained and we understood what was at the root of it.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We worked with that contractor. They're putting in place corrective actions to make sure that they deal with some of the concerns that were there. That is the only contractor that's had an extended ramp-up, so they're working back to their normal strength and we expect to see them that normal strength by the end of August.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, at this point in time, we don't see it as having a material impact on the overall progress of the work. That contractor was about one month ahead of where we expected them to be on their workflow. So, unfortunately we've used up some of that float that have built up, but we believe we're going to be able to mitigate the impact to us.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">The worker and the workforce relations are always important to us and this is one that we continue to stay focused on. It's very important as now our focus continues to shift to site and I assure you we'll stay focused with our workforce to make sure that we're trying to anticipate and deal with any other concerns.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And the second question Jay. I think in Angola Block 14, I think that the expiration is 2023. And in Nigeria the Agbami I think is 2024. When you guys will start the process for renegotiation on those?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Well, that's not something we normally are going to talk much about publicly, Paul. That's between us and our partners and the government. So, I can tell you that those discussions and the planning for that is well in hand, but I really won't be able to go into much detail on those at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Understand. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks Paul.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning. Hi.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wayne Borduin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hey Sam.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, in the Permian one of the things that you talked about contributing to your rig count staying relatively flat is that you're building up a nice stack of vintage wells and you've got some legacy production that's supporting the performance of new wells. Just really quickly Jay can you shed some light on the performance of those older wells? It sounds like you're leading edge wells are meeting your expectations, but how are the vintage wells doing as far as how are they holding up and as they get a little long in the tooth?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Actually they're doing quite well. Our focus from day one has been to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. So, there has been a lot of questions why don't we increase our rig fleet, why don't we be more aggressive? But the reality is to continue to learn as everyone in the industry as we move forward and I think a lot of the moves we've made to stay focused on returns now are paying off.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Many people talk about how high their initial production rates are in the first six months rates, but what we're really looking at that can actually damage wells and cause aggregated decline curves. So, we're looking at the total expected recovery. We're looking at the economics of the well over its life. We're very careful in our drawdown rates in those early months to make sure that we don't cause damage in the wellbore or in the formation. When we put all that together, we're seeing our base production. That is the production that's already online continuing to perform such that, when we drill these new wells, we can add that on top.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And as you saw from the chart, I believe it was on probably page nine, we've been able to continue to deliver right on our production profile and we feel very good about how our wells are performing.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you so much. And then - this one should be relatively quick and just in reference to the strategic partnership between CPChem and Qatar, Qatar's got a portfolio of other things that Chevron is probably a good candidate to participate in. Do you see that relationship deepening as you kind of advance on the chemical side throughout the Chevron organization? Or do you see that siloed into Chems?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">No. No. Look, we have a good relationship with Qatar Petroleum for sure and so do CPChem. And when the Qataris look at CPChem they look at it as three companies, right; Chevron Phillips, Phillips 66 and ourselves. And so, we have a good relationship with them.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">I will say that the trend – the deals stand on their own, I mean, the project in Qatar was bid out at U.S. Gulf Coast again there's other alternatives that are considered. So each transaction stands on its own. But we're very proud that we have this platform within and whether that leads to other opportunities or not I won’t speculate, but we certainly have a good base to work-off of.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks for taking the question. You alluded to the gas takeaway issues in the Permian and that you're trying to avoid flaring as much as possible. But of course your realized gas price was $0.60 in Q2. So I'm curious if it might get to a point where you have no practical choice, but to either flare gas or shut in wells. And if that happens which would you choose?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">We don't flare. We are not flaring and we haven't flared. Our policy is that, we find flow assurance as I said is our first priority so that we can move the gas and we've been doing that. And we've got that flow assurance covered. So I don't see us being forced into the choices that you just presented.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">I do -- as I said earlier, we're going to be increasing the amount of export capacity out of the basins to try and achieve better realizations and that's part of our overall strategy to maximize the returns that we can get from our investments in the Permian. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. And then based on what I just asked, but taking on a much broader perspective. You're talking about reducing carbon emissions. Just about every other U.S. oil and gas producers talking about the same, when we listen to what's being said on stage at the debates, I'm sure you saw this week that point seems to be lost on the policy community.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And I'm curious what you think the industry has not communicated that is -- or what the dynamic is that has led to this disconnect between what you're saying and what the policymakers seem to be believing?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Pierre Breber</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Well Sam that's a big last question on the call here. Look I mean, it depends which policymaker is right. We're in the midst of a energy revolution, renaissance here in the United States. For sure, wind and solar is a big part of that, but what's going on in the Permian Basin, what's happened in the Marcellus and Utica and growing natural gas production, growing crude oil production, exports to world markets and all the geopolitical implications and benefits of that, you can see our President talk a lot about that. At the same time, if we shared the concerns on climate change. We referred on the earnings call to a couple of investments that lower the carbon intensity of our operations. It was wind PPA in the Permian, so we -- our consumer electricity are using renewable electricity there, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the renewable natural gas, which is in California, which takes Methane that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere processes it, puts it in the grid. I guess we have off-take agreements with trucking company. It generates low carbon fuel standards under the California Regulatory Regime. It's modest capital. It earns an attractive return, so it's something that we believe is good for the environment and good for our shareholders. So we look to do more of that. We'll be very balanced, but – it's a big question, and we'll be part of the conversation.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jay Johnson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks Pavel.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">All right. Appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Wayne Borduin</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Well, I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Jonathan, back to you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Chevron's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Marilyn Mora</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks Michelle. Welcome everyone to Cisco's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 quarterly earnings conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">By now you should have seen our earnings press release a corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be made available on our Web site in the Investor Relations section following the call. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found in the financial information section of our Investor Relations Web site.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">In Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing today is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our Web site to help understand these impacts. The guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Chuck Robbins</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Marilyn. Good afternoon everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our Q4 results marked a strong end to great year. Our teams executed well through a very dynamic environment. We delivered significant innovation across our entire portfolio and we continued our business model transition with software subscriptions now at 70% of total software revenue, up 12 points year-over-year. We delivered strong revenue and double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We also continue to generate healthy margins, cash flow, and returns for our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our technology is fundamentally redefining IT architectures to help our customers manage the complexities of a multi-cloud world and transform for the future. Let me cover some recent highlights across our portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Starting with infrastructure platforms. We continue to see strong performance with broad based growth across the majority of our portfolio led by our next generation enterprise networking solutions. Over the last two years, we have built a foundation for intent-based networking by rearchitecting our entire networking portfolio to deliver new capabilities through our automation platform.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">At Cisco Live, we launched several new technology innovations across networking domains to more effectively secure and manage users and applications across the entire enterprise from campus networks and wide area networks, to data centers and the IoT Edge.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also added several AI and ML software capabilities to improve network management through automation. A great example of this is our new AI network analytics capability which delivers greater visibility and insights across the entire enterprise network.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In data center, we continue to execute well as we help enable our customers to securely access their applications and their data anywhere from private to public cloud environments as well as at the Edge. We are innovating across every facet of our portfolio integrating AI, automation, security, and assurance into our Nexus switching platforms and our 400-gig offerings. This quarter, we delivered data center network insights providing critical analytics and proactive network management capabilities through automation to increase our customers' ability to troubleshoot and remediate their environments.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also continue to invest in silicon and optics to build the next generation Internet for our customers. The recently announced intent to acquire Acacia is a good example of how we are enhancing our silicon and optics portfolio to enable web scale service provider and data center operator customers to meet today's fast growing consumer demand for data.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now turning to security, which had an incredible year. Cybersecurity continues to be the top priority for our customers, driving another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As the industry leader in networking and cybersecurity, we're investing in and extending our subscription-based security innovations across all networking domains in today's zero trust environment. By extending our ability to detect threats across public clouds and by protecting the campus, branch, WAN, and data center against threats, we are the only company providing an integrated end-to-end security architecture across multi-cloud environments.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Throughout the year, we've expanded our family of cloud security solutions to help secure identity, endpoints, and the network, which has led to accelerating customer adoption as they move or expand to the cloud. We're also extending this protection from the network to branch offices to roaming users with flexible solutions designed to secure our customers’ SD-WAN environments.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">During the quarter, we were excited to announce the availability of a full Web proxy capability on our global SaaS platform umbrella to complement our on-premise appliances. Trust plays a critical role as customers access their network and applications, and identity plays a critical role in delivering a secure consistent experience no matter how, when, or where they connect. This market dynamic was central to our Duo Security acquisition, and we continue to see customer momentum -- customer momentum reflecting the power of Duo's differentiated market leading SaaS platform.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Moving to applications. Our collaboration business continues to perform well as we execute against our strategy to accelerate the future of work, communications, and collaboration. Earlier this year, we shared our vision for cognitive collaboration, which we believe is quickly becoming the foundation to deliver massively personalized experiences and transform how we work. We are leading the market in integrating AI. and ML into our enterprise collaboration portfolio bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Through our AI-driven innovations like people insights, facial recognition, and Webex Assistant, we're driving expanded collaboration experiences on any device integrated with our customer's business process workflows. Building on these cognitive innovations, we announced our intent to acquire Voicea, a market-leading provider of voice-based artificial intelligence solutions. With Voicea's technology, we will enhance our entire Webex portfolio with a powerful transcription service combining AI and automated speech recognition to enable more actionable meetings, improve productivity, and enhance experiences.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We also achieved another outstanding quarter of growth with our AppDynamics demonstrating rapid customer adoption of our differentiated end-to-end visibility and analytics platform from the end user to the network to the application.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In summary, we had a great quarter and finish to fiscal year 2019, and I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished. We are executing well in a time of uncertainty, delivering differentiated innovation across our portfolio, and extending our market leadership and enterprise networking applications and security.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our performance reflects our relevance as well as the ongoing value we're providing our customers as they transform for the future. We are as committed as ever to providing them with the right innovation to drive greater impact and success.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As I look ahead, I could not be more confident about our unique position in the market and the tremendous opportunity in front of us.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Kelly Kramer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thanks Chuck.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Then cover the full fiscal year followed by the guidance for Q1. Q4 was a great quarter across the business. We executed well with strong revenue growth, margins, net income, and EPS. Total revenue was 13.4 billion, up 6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.6%, up 1.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was 3.6 billion, up 9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.83, up 19%.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to 10.1 billion, infrastructure platforms grew 6%, all of the businesses were up with the exception of routing. Switching had a great quarter with double-digit growth, driven by both campus and data center with the continued ramp of the Cat9k and strength of the Nexus9k.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We saw solid growth in wireless across the portfolio. Data center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and Servers. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. Applications was up 11% with collaboration, AppDynamics, and IoT software all up double digits. Security was up 14% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat, unified threat, and Web security.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Service revenue was up 4% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions where 70% of total software revenue up 12 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q4 results year-over-year, there was a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders growth was flat. Looking at our geographies Americas was up 1%, EMEA was up 4% and APJC was down 8%. Total emerging markets was down 8% with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, enterprise was down 2%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 13% and service provider was down 21%.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Remaining performance obligations or RPO at the end of Q4 was 25.3 billion. RPO is our deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred and represents total committed non-cancelable future revenue. From a non-gap profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65.5% up to 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 64.7% up 2.8 points and service gross margin was 67.9% up 0.7 points.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In terms of the bottom-line from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was 2.2 billion and EPS was $0.51. The GAAP results include a charge of approximately $900 million, which is a reversal of a tax benefit recorded in Q4 fiscal year '18, which relates to new U.S. Treasury Regulations issued during the quarter related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of 33.4 billion, operating cash flow was 3.9 billion down 4%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned 6 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of 4.5 billion of share repurchases and 1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In our Q2 fiscal '18 earnings call, we said we would return 31 billion through share repurchases over the following 18 to 24 months. As of Q4 fiscal '19, we completed that commitment with share repurchases of 32.6 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Going forward, we will return to our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through share repurchases and dividends.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline, during Q4 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia, an existing supplier that is focused on Optical Interconnect Technologies. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment and innovation and R&amp;D for our growth areas.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong revenue growth margins, net income, EPS and operating cash flow. Revenue was 51.7 billion up 7%, total non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6% up 0.3 points and our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.3% up 0.7 points.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">From a bottom-line perspective, non-GAAP net income was 13.8 billion up 9% and non-GAAP EPS was $3.10 up 20%. GAAP net income was 11.6 billion and GAAP EPS was $2.61.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We delivered operating cash flow of 15.8 billion up 16%, normalized for the tax payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in each fiscal year and the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was up 8%.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">To summarize, we had a strong Q4 and fiscal year. We executed well a strong top-line growth and profitability and we're seeing the returns in the investments we're making in innovation, driving the shift to more software and subscriptions delivering long-term growth in shareholder value.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes a type of forward-looking information that Marilyn refer to earlier. Note that we have normalized our first quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q1 fiscal '19, which we divested in October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We expect revenue growth in the range of 0% to 2% year over year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-gap operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33% and non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. The 1% increase in tax rate over fiscal '19 is primarily due to a forecasted decrease in tax benefit from foreign income. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.80 to $0.82.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">I'll turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into the Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Marilyn Mora</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thanks Kelly. Michelle let's go ahead and tee up and open the line for questions. And while Michelle is doing that I'd like to remind the audience to limit yourself to one question.</p>, <p class=""p p4"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you. Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong><span class=""question"">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I'm going to ask the obvious one and then maybe pepper in a little bit of detailed color if I can get it. The guidance is weaker than, I think we had anticipated, we know it's a tough macro environment. So, just hoping Chuck that you would maybe comment on that? And maybe juxtapose the change in trend in enterprise orders which did weaken quite a bit with commercial which seems to be holding up fine and kind of why that is going on? And then, Kelly, if you could comment on backlog as well, I know you guys usually give it in the K, so it would be great to get that number as well. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Hey, Rod. Thanks for the question. So, let me start by saying first of all the strategy and the work that we've done on our portfolio and the engagement with our customers is absolutely going in the right direction and we continue to make progress and the strategy is working. So, we're quite happy with what our teams have accomplished and where we are right now in that space. There's a couple of things that we saw in the quarter and I'll outline these, and then I'll answer Rod to your question about the enterprise.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">First is that, we had continued challenges in service provider and I'll double click on that in just a moment. As you saw in the order growth that Kelly talked about. And then, we did see in July some slight early indications of some macro shifts that we didn't see in the prior quarter. So, those are the two things that happened.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let me double click on service provider just a bit. The Americas was generally the same from an order perspective from the prior quarter, so no real shift positive or negative. Europe was actually positive in the SP space. In Asia, we saw continued weakening in our China service provider business and we had two massive build outs in India a year ago that just didn't replicate this year with the two major players there. That's the net of the service provider situation it's not more complicated than that.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">If you look at our overall business, our orders outside of service provider grew mid-single digits. So, we feel good in this environment about the rest of the portfolio and the work that we're doing to those customers. As it relates to commercial enterprise and public sector and I'm going to probably give you a little more granularity than normal just so you understand with what we believe went on.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">You can see that the portfolio that is being sold into all three of those segments is obviously being well received. Our public sector business on a global basis was up 13%. So, we continue to see success and as you mentioned Rod, global commercial was up 7. The enterprise business was really, we saw weakness in China, which was contributed to it. We saw some weakness in the U.K. in enterprise, and then candidly in the U.S. as much as I don't want to use compares for an excuse, we had two major software deals a year ago that were tough to compare against. So, that's really it. The rest of the business and everything we see is still very positive, and we feel good about where we are.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks for that Chuck.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yes. Right, on your backlog question, since we adopted ASC 606, we've been disclosing our RPO, which is a more meaningful metric of our future revenue because again with the problem with our backlog, it didn't include our subscription businesses, so it didn't include anything on collaboration or security. So, RPO has everything it has, the deferred revenue, the unbilled deferred, and any committed future revenue and like we’ve disclosed in our Qs, we expect -- of that 25.3 billion, we expect about 56% of that to be recognized over the next 12 months.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Rod Hall</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. Thanks a lot Kelly.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Paul Silverstein with Cowen. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Silverstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">I appreciate it. Just a follow-up from Rod's question, Chuck, a clarification. I felt China was not down or had been down for a while. So, well, less than 3% of revenue and I guess that's not zero. So, you still have exposure. But, I'm surprised it impacted you to the extent you suggested.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And then, I want to ask Kelly about the pricing environment, I assume there's been no change in what we should expect for margins throughout the year. I assume they're going up on both the gross and the operating line given DRAM and the ongoing shift in software, along with benign pricing environment, but if you could comment on that.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. Let me just comment on the China situation. I mean you're right, it's down below 3, it's a small part of our business, but obviously when it falls very dramatically, it can still have some impact because it is greater than zero. But, long term, it's not a concern that I worry about much at this point. And so, that's really the extent of what we saw there. I mean the China reduction contributed to a point of the issue in all of enterprise for us. So, it was that significant, and we definitely saw significant impact on our business in China as it relates to what's going on with the trade war right now.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">And then, Paul on your margin question. So, yes, pricing, the environment stays good, actually we had a very good quarter on pricing. It was less than a point that you'll see when we give you the Q. So, that's been very good. And again, you can see, we are benefiting in our gross margins and OMs from the tailwind from DRAM as we expected and you're seeing that in not only the results but also as we've been guiding on the margin.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Silverstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks Paul. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Tejas Venkatesh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. You obviously give a year-over-year order growth number every quarter, but I wonder if you could give us a sense of what the sequential looks like versus historical seasonality. If I have my math right sequential order growth looks somewhat in line with seasonality, but your revenue guide is a tad below where you've grown sequentially in recent years. So I just want to confirm that's right.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And then, secondly, you're coming off a strong year of 7% revenue growth. I know you don't guide for the year, but expect -- investor expectations were somewhat high and I wonder if you could comment even qualitatively on how to think about full year revenue growth. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hey, Tejas. So, yes, you're right on our sequential down orders. I mean if we've had this phenomena -- it's not a phenomena, but our Q4 always has a double-digit growth in Q4, it's our largest quarter from a dollar perspective on orders growth for us. So, that happen and then I -- again in Q1 it's double-digit down. So, the sequential isn't a change from historical and again the year-over-year takes into account the kind of phenomenon we're seeing now.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In terms of the long-term guide, again, we don't give more than one quarter. I would say to Chuck's earlier point in terms of how we feel about the portfolio and the margins and the update we feel good about that. The macro and the certain segment issues like SP, I think that I don't foresee that. I'm not planning on that changing in the near-term.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Okay. Thanks Kelly. Michelle, next question.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Sami Badri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could kind of just give us an update on the campus switching refresh. And then, perhaps maybe your view on where we'll be next year as you see the campus switching cycle playing out and maybe even potentially more consistent data center switching deployments play out especially, since we're going through some transitions in an industry. So, I guess what I really wish we all understand is, where we are in the cycle, where we in like the fifth maybe sixth maybe even first or second ending the way you see it and then maybe the equivalent of where we see that for data center switching for your customers?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hey, Sami. Thanks. It's a great question. So, in the last 120, 180 days, I mean we completed the full refresh of our portfolio across switching, routing and wireless in the enterprise. And we're now in a position where all of those have mandatory subscriptions. So we've made that transition from a product development perspective and now those are all out in the marketplace with our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">On the catalyst 9000, Q4 was the -- we added more customers in Q4 for the catalyst 9000 than in any quarter prior. So, that continues to move forward favorably. In the campus what I would suggest to you is that we're -- I'd say maybe we're in the second inning at this point of this transition that we see from our customers. As you know they're all rearchitecting their entire enterprise infrastructure to accommodate these traffic flows that are presented from the massive number of cloud applications that they're running. And so it requires a completely different architecture which is what this portfolio is built for.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As it relates to data center, I think that next year you'll probably begin to see some upgrades transitions when the pure 400 gig optics are available. And one of the things that we believe is a big differentiator for us is that we're extending this policy management out of the data center into the campus, from the campus into the wide area, from the wide area into the cloud security portfolios. So, we think being able to enable our customers to deliver policy from the data center all the way across the campus to the branch into the cloud is a very unique differentiator for us. And we think, we'll begin to see customers adopting and deploying that sometime in the next year as well. So that's how we see that playing out.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Sami Badri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Got it. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. Tal Liani from Bank of America. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Tal Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. Hi, guys. If you look at the growth this quarter, it's about 1%. And then, a few quarters ago.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey, Tal. Can you speak up just a little bit?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Tal Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. Can you hear me?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. Better, yes.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Tal Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">I'll pick it up here you go. Now it's better. This quarter you're guiding for 1% growth, a few quarters ago, you reported 8%, but you had roughly organically growing -- you were growing about 4% to 4.5%. Can you take the 1% did you have now, and then build on top of it all the things that you're seeing today to see what's the growth environment now that is more sustainable going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I'm trying -- I have difficulties to go from 4%, 4.5% to 1% within like three quarters. And if it's not a major deceleration in the growth environment what could it be? So you mentioned China, what are the other things that are happening today that are unique to Q1 that are bringing the growth down so much from the levels we've seen just a few quarters ago.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey, Tal. I'll take a crack at it. I mean at the end of the day, when we are guiding it's based on what we're seeing with the orders [around] [ph] and the pipeline and everything else. And the biggest driver of the guide where it is, is the massive decline we've seen in service provider over the last few quarters. So, that is the biggest driver. Again, like Chuck said, we feel good about the risk portfolio from [indiscernible] perspective growing in the -mid single digits. But, China is part of it, but again like we said it's small in comparison, but SP is still a large part of the business and that's driving this outlook that you're seeing.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Tal Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So, what's the -- can you quantify this, can you quantify what is the decline in the growth related to service providers and you think you mentioned one point is related to China. Am I correct?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">We are talking about for that is, for the orders rate that we just had -- the order rates for enterprise being down 2 points, 1 point of that at the global level was adjusted China alone. China overall was down over 25% this quarter for us.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Tal Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Got it. And if I can just have a follow up on China. We always thought that you're not selling much in China. It's hard to compete in China. Where are you --w here did you have position in China. I know you were selling some routers to service providers, but where are you selling in China and what's being impacted in China, what are the types of products that you're selling into the Chinese market.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Let me just give you a little bit of color then Kelly I can give you some numbers. I mean tell the overall Chinese market as I said earlier is certainly not a major play for us, but it has just dropped precipitously in light of the trade discussions. So, it has a short-term impact and if you were -- where we are selling for years we've sold infrastructure to the large carriers in China, which has just -- it's been slowly declining and we saw it even decline more rapidly last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then, what we've seen is in the state-owned enterprises anymore, we're just being we're being uninvited to bid. We're not being allowed to even participate anymore. So those are the enterprises that's where the large impact was this past quarter, so it was just a much faster decline of what we candidly expected.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. And I would just add to that. So, again we talk about the big impact that had on enterprise. It was -- the second largest was down in service provider which is part of our overall service provider being down. But, from a product perspective, we sell everything there from switches, routers all the way down through security and Meraki products. So we sell everything including collab in China and everything is being impacted.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Tai Liani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Tal. Next question.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you very much, Chuck and Kelly, you've been very clear about the softness in revenues. When offer the outlook, when you think about the outlook and a lot of it seems to be service provider, softness that has not been a new theme you've talked about it for the past several quarters. So, where we sit today looking out, is there a lot of risk that it could get worse or you kind of looking at this saying, we're kind of near a bottom for service provider trends because it's been chugging along pretty low and they're starting to sweat their assets potentially. Or is there still some risk that you have, they're just kind of thinking about the service provider headwinds. Could it get worse, or is it you looking at it and saying hey we're calling for a bottom.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Look I think that, when you get into this area there, there is certainly pressure in the business models across all different types of service providers. I think that if you look at the early 5G build outs, most of the telco customers, we have particularly in Americas, they're focused on the consumer 5G trials today they're not -- I mean that is the primary focus. And then getting their 5G consumer networks built out. But they also don't -- I would say don't anticipate that being a huge profit driver off of the 5G transition that's going to come when they build more robust broader 5G infrastructure where they'll deliver enterprise services and that's going to come after they do the consumer side.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, it's a bit unclear when that will take place. I'd say we're not modeling and don't anticipate any significant improvement in this business in the very near term. And we're just going to have to wait and see. It's been a tough business for us for years and it's now -- it obviously represents a much smaller percentage of our business than it did five years ago. But it clearly was a major point of weakness for us in the last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Suva</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Do you want to add anything to that Kelly?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I think you got it.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Chuck. Let's go ahead and take the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead sir.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">James Faucette</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great. Thanks. I just had a couple of questions, one related to gross margins and one to the deferred revenue. On gross margins, Kelly, it looks like even though the July quarter was very good, is that you're guiding for both the gross margins to be flat to down a little bit and sequentially historically we've seen at least some improvement. So I'm wondering if you can help parse a little bit what may be going on there. And my second question is, deferred revenue actually looks quite good. So, can you give us some insight into how much of that may be ELAs or software or other aspects, so we can get a little bit more color on what's driving the deferred revenue? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So, on the margin, yes, I mean I'd say the margins are going great. We feel good about it. I kept the range in that 64% to 65% to take into account the cutting end of list four of the tariffs. Again, we're going to run the same play that we have for all the other tariffs and we'll be -- again we continue to mitigate, we continue to do everything we can do. But, we see that in that range, which I think is pretty good. And as you look as that falls down through them and are actually doing well and I've actually raised a little bit on the OM guide.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So again, I think we're able to offset the headwinds from tariffs was again continued benefit from the software which leads to your point of the deferred revenue. Yes, I mean again we continue to add to deferred revenue, which again is why I think look at that RPO is a key metric which has both the deferred revenue as well as unbilled deferred when you have month-to-month contracts, it shows the progress we've made.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Just to remind you guys, we adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of the fiscal year, we wrote-off 2.8 billion from our deferred revenue balance for the new accounting rule. And again, you're seeing just big sequential increases since then as we just continue to ramp the portfolio with like for example the entire enterprise portfolio that all have subscriptions.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So it's broad based, we continue to have great adoption of the new products, all the subscriptions we have great adoption of the ELAs. We had really strong performance of software and ELAs in Q4. So, it's all going in the right direction which is again that's why we're still despite any macro environment why we're so bullish on the overall strategy of the company what we're doing an a transformation.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey, James. If I might add to that, I know like three years ago, I think I made a comment on one of the earnings calls that I felt like we had figured out how we could drive a subscription business on top of networking products. And now here we are and we've got every product in our portfolio in the enterprise networking now that has mandatory subscription. And we really started showing that two years ago, so the first renewal window is really still a year away. So that's -- the team has done a great job that transition has been good. We're on track with what we told everyone in the Financial Analyst Conference where we'd be relative to our software. And I think that's what you're seeing show up in the RPO metrics as well.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks Chuck. Next question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Tim Long from Barclays. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Tim Long</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Yes. Just to follow-up and another question if I could. Chuck, you mentioned a little bit of the weakness was also related to some macro shifts in the month of July. Could you talk a little bit about that kind of what we are seeing with deals pushing out, scaling down more competition or anything like that? And then, you also had mentioned the move to 400 gig upgrades next year. Could you talk a little bit about how you think Cisco will fare in these data center deals as we move to 400 gig and this strategy to take in-house and develop more optics internally, do you think that helps as early as that 400 gig transition? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Thanks Tim. So basically we just felt a slight difference in July. I mean relative to close rates and just -- it just wasn't as strong a finish as we would normally expect particularly in Q4 and I think that's what kind of set off the flags for Kelly and I. I've met with 17 customers in the last five, six business days and nothing's changed about how they're thinking about the role of technology and what we do and how we're playing there. So we're monitoring this, we're watching it, we'll see. Obviously, I think what we've seen in the markets in the last few weeks and what we hear from some of the other players would indicate that others have seen similar things some a lot worse.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And I do feel very good about our position and where we are in the level of criticality that we are playing with our customers now versus five, six years ago and I think that. So, I feel good about that piece. But, that's really what we felt and we'll just have to see how it plays out and whether we get any resolution on some of these major geopolitical issues that are sort of lingering out there.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I've said for like 18 months that I've been amazed at the resilience of the economy and hopefully it can bounce back pretty quick if we get to some -- get more clarity on some of these issues which I think people are just -- I think they're just hedging their bets relative to some resolution on some of the stuff.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then, the second question was around -- oh around the 400 gig and around. Yes, I'll tell you -- we have -- I feel good about it, number one, where we're in the game. We have our technology roadmaps mapped out. Our teams have made these acquisitions, which allows us to have good control of our components that go into these products. We've talked to lots of customers including the Web scale providers who are very supportive of where we're headed what we're doing. They're supportive of the strategy. They like the acquisitions. And so, we feel good that we'll be in a good place in a much better position to compete in this transition than we were last time around. So I feel good about where we are.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Tim Long</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Simon Leopold from Raymond James. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Simon Leopold</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you for taking the question. I know you don't want to guide beyond the quarter, but maybe if you could help us sort of level set how to think about the year given that I think you're facing a pretty tough comparison in October. And so guiding 0% to 2% seems to set a new level, but if I just apply normal seasonality through the balance of the year, it would look like the year-over-year growth rate should come back somewhat in the January through July quarters. I just want to see how we should think about really the full fiscal year trending.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. Hey, Simon. I think the way you're looking at, I mean, again, we don't guide and again there's a lot of unknown out there. But, I'll say the way you think about kind of the right way. I think the way you're thinking about the second half certainly, you get more normalized compares on that in the second half. But, I think the way you're looking at it is very rational.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Simon Leopold</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And just a quick, do you have a metric for percent of revenue that's recurring. I think you've given it in the past and then with the fiscal year over hope you maybe have that number.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I know, Simon, we started this fiscal year on that, when we adopted 606 because a lot of our recurring subscriptions like for example D&amp;A, with the Cat9K because of the accounting it changes how we have to recognize it. So that's why really the metric that that we talk about now is how much of our software revenue is subscription based, so recurring isn't as meaningful.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Simon Leopold</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks Simon. Next question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Kvaal</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you very much. Kelly, you had mentioned a little earlier that you're taking the operating margin up a shade. I wonder if you could comment on how you are making the magic happen there in light of a little bit of a lower revenue trajectory than we all might have hoped for a few months ago. And then, just to clarify your capital return plan sounds like it's going to be mostly about the dividend here rather than buybacks going forward. Well thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, sure. So on, yes, on the profitability on OM, I think it's not magic, right? It is -- we are working the gross margins hard with like we talked earlier. And then, we're also work in the OpEx side hard as always as well our engineering teams do a really good job of rebalancing their portfolios and making sure they're investing in the right stuff and we are constantly driving for efficiency. So, it's good old fashioned running the business and executing well despite the top-line. So, that's how that's happening and on the capital allocation.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. So, if you go back to when we dig a tax reform back in Q2 of '18 and we announced the big buyback, we had a 31 billion authorization then and we said we'd use that 31 billion. We did effectively use that up through -- up till now, the 18 months. And so, now, since we've really gotten our balance sheet where we want it in terms of -- we reduced our debt. We've brought our cash balance from 74 billion back then now to 33 billion. We've reduced our debt from 35 down to 25. We're going to get back to our normal strategy, which is being very opportunistic when our stocks down like on days like today in buying. But, really balancing between both the dividend and the buyback to be at least 50% of our free cash flow.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Kvaal</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Marilyn Mora</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks Kelly. Chuck. Our last question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Samik Chatterjee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance you guys mentioned the service provider weakness is kind of what's driving the weakness, and then, although there seems to be a broader concern here from investors relative to a slowdown in enterprise spending. So, I just want to get your thoughts particularly given the change in the business towards kind of higher software subscription mix. How should we think about levers you can pull to drive growth even if enterprise spending does kind of see a slowdown next year?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And just a quick follow up. At Cisco Live, the team had talked about a major refresh of the collaboration portfolio. So just I want to see what the early response to that refresh has been. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. I think one thing that is, I think important to look at is, when we talk about enterprise spending and when many companies talk about enterprise spending that would be -- in some cases a combination at a minimum of our enterprise and commercial business and in some cases people would just include public sector in there and that's sort of a view. And that when you put it all together was actually quite healthy, the orders were quite healthy. We just had a little bit in July of a feel that -- we just didn't close as strong as we would like. And so, we felt like there was even more that we could have done. And it just didn't feel like a normal Q4 finish and it felt a little bit like some of the macro issues may be manifesting themselves. So, that's really what we saw there. And then, Kelly, you want to talk about the software and…</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kelly Kramer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. I mean, again, just on the software, I think again because more and more -- again, even despite like I talked about the write-off on deferred revenue -- the adoption of 606 even despite that the amount of revenue -- software revenue coming off the balance sheet continue just to grow as we put more on the balance sheet. So that helps to buffer when you do go through any tough macro issues. So, I think we'll continue to add to that and it'll continue to help soften whenever there is any kind of macro slowdown. But, it's helping maintain kind of the growth that we do see going as well as margins.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Samik Chatterjee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sorry. Any feedback on the collaboration portfolio?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Robbins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. I think what Amy and the team have been doing is really -- they've been refreshing new elements of the portfolio with end units, end points they've been, they've consolidated the -- to a single user interface. We've got new refresh versions of Webex out there. They're bringing the cognitive capabilities in, there's a lot of new technology that they've been bringing. So, I think they're in the midst of delivering on that right now and the result in that business would suggest that our customers are viewing it favorably because it continues to perform really well for a decent sized business. Is that all?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Samik Chatterjee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Thank you. That's it.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Chuck Robbins</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. So, I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I look -- we're four years in and I'm really proud of what our teams have accomplished. I mean we've come a long way in four years. And I don't actually judge where we are based on this quarter. I think or the quarterly guidance, I think that what we've built in the portfolio and the innovation and the value that we bring to our customers is sustaining and we'll continue to do that with our customers going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We have a strong record of our execution. I have high conviction in the portfolio and I think we're well positioned for long-term growth opportunities. So, thanks all of you for spending time with us today and thanks for the questions.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Marilyn Mora</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">All right. Thanks Chuck. So, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2020 first quarter results will be on Wednesday, November 13, 2019, at 130 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done to an explicit public disclosure.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We now plan to close the call, if you have any further questions feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations Group. And we thank you very much for joining today.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And thank you for participating on today's conference call.

In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. [Operator Instructions].</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now let me turn the call over to James.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>James Quincey</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So here we are halfway through the year, and we see good momentum in our business as we continue our transformation as a total beverage company. We gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets led by strong performance in our sparkling soft drink business. Organic revenue growth is up 6% year-to-date, including growth across all operating segments and with a good balance between volume and pricing. Worth noting, about a point of that is due to benefit of timing. The underlying results, though, are still ahead of plan.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Unit case growth -- volume grew 2% year-to-date and 3% in the quarter. Comparable currency-neutral EPS was up 13% year-to-date, partially offset by a stronger-than-anticipated 9% currency headwind resulting in comparable EPS growth of 3%. While currencies continued to be headwind, we are focused on achieving our full year EPS target through stronger performance in the underlying business.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half driven by both developed and emerging markets. In Asia Pacific, we grew organic revenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 7% volume growth for the segment as we focused on underserved consumption occasions. This was partially offset by performance in Japan where our system continues to work through supply chain disruptions stemming from last year's natural disasters.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In addition, volume declined in Japan during the second quarter as our system implemented the first price increase to consumers in over 25 years. Looking ahead, we expect improving results in the back half as consumers adjust to the new pricing levels and we implement a robust innovation plan including Coke Energy and Innocent chilled juice.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to EMEA. Here, we grew organic revenue 9% year-to-date driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey, improved performance in South Africa and the first quarter benefit from our shipment timing. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets as shown by the 3% volume growth in our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. And in Turkey, despite the challenging macro environment, we are delivering a solid performance due to strong marketing and execution plans that are quickly adapting to the local conditions.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to Latin America. Here we delivered 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date amidst a mixed operating environment. Brazil continues to deliver strong performance driven by better execution within a stable operating environment while Argentina continues to grapple with the economic crisis. Mexico's economic growth is slowing so we expect tougher operating conditions. However, we are adjusting our plans to ensure affordability, so that the business continues to grow sustainably.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Finally, turning to North America. Here, our results continued to mark steady progress driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen-measured channels. Strong revenue growth for our core sparkling soft drink brands continues to fuel and enable new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage portfolio. For example, our premium water brands, smartwater and Topo Chico, are delivering healthy growth supported by the national launch of smartwater antioxidant and smartwater alkaline and the ongoing strategic expansion of Topo Chico.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Across all of our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth and aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Beginning with our portfolio growth. Here, we are making progress in operationalizing our leader, challenger and explorer framework consistent with the strategy we outlined last year. Within our leaders, the core sparkling soft drink business registered healthy volume growth of 2% year-to-date with trademark Coke continuing to perform very well with volume up 3% year-to-date and 4% in the quarter fueling our portfolio expansion. Importantly, we're seeing healthy household penetration growth for our sparkling soft drink portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Whilst also encouraging is Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth. Along with our focus on smaller packaging and premium innovation, year-to-date, we are growing trademark Coke revenue faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing calories, what we believe is a winning strategy for the future. Our innovation pipeline. Our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with the launch of Coke Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster, and we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The initial results are encouraging. In Spain, the first market where Coke Energy was launched, has already captured 2% share of the energy category modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for outlet as the market leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. We're taking everything we have learned and applying these insights as we rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 countries, and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available in 20 markets. Coke Energy, along with many of our other innovations, are being created to target specific occasions and need states but in very different ways, particularly as we grow our challengers and explorers. For example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from its success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink with zero added sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid-morning or afternoon energizing snack. With this, our focus on consumer-centric innovation, almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% 2 years ago.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">At the same time, we are taking a disciplined approach to curating our portfolio to ensure we have the capacity to focus on the right brands. So far, this year, over 275 zombie SKUs have been eliminated. We're also making progress on our plans to build a multiplatform coffee business. Since we finalized the Costa acquisition in January, we've been moving with speed across three areas: integrating Costa into our business, making sure Costa's existing clients are executed well and accelerating the opportunity to build a multiplatform business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As we move forward on these opportunities, our focus is on accelerating three segments: the express vending machines, beans and machines for food service customers and ready-to-drink products. We've already launched ready-to-drink products in the U.K. with plans to roll out in additional markets in the coming months. And consistent with our other innovations, ready-to-drink Costa leverages a unique brand and product edge that will allow us to capture category growth.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We're also accelerating our plans to roll out more express machines across a number of markets. So far, this year, we've placed 1,200 new vending machines and have plans for many more by the end of the year. Finally, as you may have seen last week, we reached an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic to launch Costa Coffee across a number of formats within all their markets over the next three years.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Returning to the overall view. Of course, none of this works without our bottling partners. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized and committed to building scale and investing into the future, and we're working with them to collectively raise the bar on our consistent execution. I've talked before about the revenue growth management initiatives, which are helping to drive increased velocity in our portfolio. Coupled with this has been a focus on expanding horizontal distribution through opening new outlets and placing more cold drink equipment. And we're making progress, especially in Asia where our system opened over 750,000 new outlets so far this year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">However, gaining penetration is only part of the equation. Consistently measuring and managing our performance in existing outlets is the other part that drives sustained performance. So, we're working to better leverage data and mobile technology in order to evolve our Right Execution Daily platform from a point-in-time scorecard into real-time integrated analytics capabilities that will drive faster and better-formed execution decisions across our system.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Before moving off our bottling system, let me quickly our address our plans in Africa. In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the bottler until we move through a period of political and economic change in the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn't changed. As with all our bottling investments, we will look to sell at the right time to the right buyer. In the meantime, we have a new and energized leadership teams on both sides of the system, and we are already seeing promising results.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Finally, in order to deliver long-term, sustainable growth, we must collaborate with our stakeholders. One critical issue facing the world is plastic waste. In 2018, we announced our World Without Waste goals through recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We used approximately 30% recycled material in our packaging globally in 2018. We now have 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019. And importantly, our system is also working to improve collection. We currently refill or collect equivalent of 58% of what we sell in the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">While global traction will take time given the need for infrastructure investments and various regulations by our market, we're actively working to lift and shift successful collection models such as PETCO in South Africa, ECOCE in Mexico and Coca-Cola Amatil is already leading our collaboration to run a deposit return scheme across all of its territories in Australia. Ultimately, the heart of our success are our people. We've been working to continue to build our growth culture because that is what will drive our performance year-after-year, moving faster, taking intelligent risks and learning from our mistakes. And I think this is beginning to show in our results.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">So, in summary, we had a good first half of the year as evidenced by our solid organic growth rate. We're driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. And the momentum in our business gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now I'll turn it over to John.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>John Murphy</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Before addressing our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to start by discussing a few key areas that I believe are critical to the company, specifically, driving healthy top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments, improving cash flow and leveraging a disciplined capital allocation process.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">James has talked about our revenue growth management efforts. This quarter, we've continued to scale our work in both Asia and Latin America. We're implementing better analytical tools and processes to develop price/pack architectures to meet evolving consumer and customer needs. And it's showing results, contributing to the robust organic revenue growth we've delivered now for the past eight quarters. Translating top line performance into sustainable margin improvement is where our ongoing productivity efforts and leader, challenger, explorer framework come into play. For the first half of the year, we delivered underlying operating margin improvement, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We've also advanced our efforts to improve cash flow and capital allocation. We're improving our working capital as evidenced by our year-to-date cash flow increase. We're taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. For example, we're in the process of selling our building in New York and we recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler. And we are reducing the sizable costs related to our productivity program that were part of the transformation of our business. So, we're making progress, and we aim to do even better.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning now to our financial performance in the quarter. We delivered another solid quarter with broad-based organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 6% with a healthy balance of price/mix and volume and a 1-point benefit from timing. Our developing and emerging markets drove strong volume performance, which resulted in strong growth in our Bottling Investments Group. A continued rollout of revenue growth management initiatives across our developed markets resulted in good price/mix.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Comparable margins contracted in the second quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency. However, both growth and operating margins expanded on an underlying basis. This translated into 14% currency-neutral operating income growth, partially offset by an 8-point currency headwind. The currency impact to operating income included a 2-point impact from hedging activity driven entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Comparable EPS grew 4% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by a stronger-than-expected 9% currency headwind. And finally, year-to-date free cash flow was up $3.7 billion, up 87% due largely to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of cash taxes and capital expenditures. While we do not expect a similar increase in the back half of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver at least $6 billion in free cash flow.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now looking at the remainder of the year. For the first half, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, and as James noted, about a point of this came from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. But after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance, and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit than we expected at the beginning of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As you model the flow of the year, there's a few items to consider in terms of phasing due to cycling, the timing of shipments and expenses, moderating currency headwinds and an extra day in the fourth quarter. We expect all of the comparable operating income growth in the back half of the year to occur in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Specific to currency in the third quarter, we expect a 6-point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 3-point impact from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year as year-over-year spot rate headwinds are softening. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind. Looking even further out at current spot rates and hedge positions, we expect a benign currency environment in 2020 compared to 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build out your models for the year. So, in summary, we've had a strong first half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong performance in our business. Cash flow is improving, and we remain very focused on delivering our full year EPS guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Operator, we are now ready for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p5"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Stephen Powers</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">So, a very solid set of results today. I guess the question from here, notwithstanding some of the timing factors that may cause some movement in the back half, just is what makes you most confident that this momentum can continue, if not further improve as you look out over the next few years?</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And perhaps as an underappreciated part of that story, how do you view improvements in your -- the current bottling footprint factoring into that momentum? I mean bottling clearly contributed this quarter. And I guess the question is that an aberration? Or do you see bottling contributions as potentially sustainably accretive to total company top line and profit growth over the next couple of years?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let me try and offer three thoughts, Steve. Firstly, I think we have in front of us a tremendous long-term opportunity in the beverage industry. I'd refer you back to one of the pages we've used in one of the investor decks with the two bottles, the one of the developed worlds and the one of the developing worlds. With the developed world is a small portion of the world's population, 20% of the population of the world. Yes, there, 3/4 of what they drink is a commercial beverage, but we still have a relatively small share of that in aggregate and we're gaining share. So, there's huge opportunity for value growth in the developed world.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And yet in the developing part of the world, which is 80% of the world population, only 1/4 of what they drink evolves from commercial beverage. And again, our share has lots of room for expansion. So, the first point is I would reunderline the long-term opportunity for growth of commercial beverages in the developed and the developing markets, and that's a huge opportunity in front of us.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The second thought I would offer you is I think we're seeing not just momentum in the second quarter or the year-to-date, and yes, leave aside some of the timing benefits, but what we're seeing is a sustained set of results over if you want to take the last four quarters and you average out the unit cases and you average out the price/mix of the last four quarters to just give you a year, I think you get about two in volume and about three in price. And if you were to do the calculation, I think you'd end up with a three on price with or without BIG. So, I think you're seeing sustained momentum of the core business over a 12-month period. And perhaps even more encouragingly, that is now lapping a period where we were also in the band we were looking for, for our long-term growth model of 4% to 6%. So, we've now got 5% in round numbers lapping 5%. So, I think the momentum is now multiyear. I always encourage everyone to look at some multiquarter average given where we are in the supply chain and the timing effects. So long-term opportunities, and we're now building momentum that is called multiyear momentum.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And I think to the question of how much BIG can affect that going forward, yes. Look, we've clearly given the BIG team a mission to grow the top line and the bottom line. I think the countries that did well this quarter are -- happened to be the countries where we own the parts of the bottling operation. So that obviously -- that obviously was very helpful. But BIG is centered in a number of countries that have long-term growth prospects. They're largely in the bottle but is only 1/4 commercial beverages. So, they have a lot of opportunity, and we've given them a clear mission to abandon the concept of the hospital ward. We should be aspiring for bottling operations we own to be just as good as all the other bottling operations, and obviously, we'll look to find the right owner at the right time. And therefore, yes, we should expect the BIG operations to do better in the coming years.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Dara Mohsenian</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">John, you opened up the door crack on 2020 earnings guidance with the benign FX comment. I know you won't give us an explicit guidance range today, but I guess just conceptually, besides FX, are there any big puts or takes we should think about for 2020 versus the typical EPS growth algorithm you've outlined? And also, maybe perhaps you can discuss if FX were to worsen and become more unfavorable from the spot rates where we are today, are there any leverage can pull to offset that from the earnings growth perspective as you look out to 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. No. Thanks, Dara. It's still very early days to talk about 2020. As you know, there's a number of factors that go into how we'll ultimately perform in 2020. The global macro environment continues to be pretty volatile. There's a lot of discussions as to where interest rates will land. And in some of our -- the markets that are particularly important to us, places like Mexico, like Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, there's a lot of moving parts there. So, it's very early to talk about 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I do think it's -- it is good to look at 2020 though in the context of currency. We think the dollar is at the -- towards the end of a strong cycle, and hence, we think that we're in for a benign environment over the next year, 1.5 years.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">With respect to sort of managing the potential headwinds from currency, I think we're starting to connect the dots better across the world between the decisions that need to be taken locally to help us have a more holistic approach to dealing with this topic because it's not going away. We -- the emerging markets represent almost 50% of our PBT. So, in the future, it's going to be a very important topic for us to address even better. So early days yet on that. But certainly, connecting the dots better, and as I said in the call, for the back half of the year, the upside on underlying operating performance is actually helping us to maintain our full year guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Bryan Spillane</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the strength in the Asia Pacific segment. It's been pretty good so far first half of the year. And so maybe, James, if you could just dig in a little bit in terms of what's driving that underlying performance, and really what I'm after is, I guess, as we're kind of looking beyond this year, sort of some view of whether or not this type of performance is sustainable.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Sure. I mean clearly, we had a good quarter in Asia Pacific. I think we were somewhat helped by the kind of a later monsoon in India or the later start of the monsoon in India. So, I think one would be cautious in extrapolating one quarter into the future. But clearly, this quarter, we saw good growth in India, good growth in ASEAN, particularly in the Philippines, in Thailand, in Vietnam. We saw some good growth in China. Actually, that was despite deprioritizing some of the low-value water, and we're cycling the best quarter of last year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">But I think what is representative of is the long-term continued opportunity for the beverage business. We basically -- most of the money comes in from the Americas, North and South America, Europe and Japan and Australia. But that's a small part of the world's population. Actually, if you take Africa, if you take Indian subcontinent, ASEAN and China, that's the vast majority of the world's population, and we're only getting started. And that's where we're seeing good growth this quarter and we have been seeing it for a while. So, I think it's representative of the long-term opportunity. I wouldn't say let's extrapolate this one quarter, but there's absolutely long-term opportunity in those four large population zones.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Ali Dibadj</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So, one big controversy for investors around Coke is that as you transitioned from Coca-Cola of old to total beverage company, your margins will be pressured. And so, to zero in from that kind of broad controversy into the quarter, you provided this gross margin and operating margin bridge set of charts. Can you just aggregate please the ""underlying green,"" i.e., positive bar more in terms of cost savings, one, negative sales mix, maybe geographic mix and price/mix, really with an idea of trying to get us comfortable with the sustainability and maybe positive momentum in margins. And particularly this quarter, we saw SG&amp;A as a percent of sales improve, but that overall controversy remains on the margins. And then if I might, just a very quick clarification. You mentioned Coke Energy rolling out to 20 countries by the end of this year. Is the U.S. on that list?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So, let me start. I'm not sure there's a controversy at all. I think we've been super clear on what we believe is happening on the operating margins and I think, clearly, there's a couple of things happening here. And I would not all rotate on one quarter because of the movements of gallons and those sorts of things. I'll talk about the first half because that's -- I would prefer to talk about four quarters rather than even two, but let's go in.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, I think our messaging has been very clear: the mechanical changes to the operating income margin happened because of ins and outs, particularly of bottling operations given their very different cost structures and the acquisitions, and I think that's clear on the chart. And I think what you can clearly see is we continue to execute against our game plan to improve operating margins over time. We've been tracking on that towards the target that we had talked about, but given all the confusion, we've removed and had this bridge instead.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So ongoing improvement in operating income margin, that's been happening and it's happened again in the second quarter or the first half. It's clearly driven by the sum of the parts. We're getting improved pricing. Yes, some of those are in categories, which have higher cost of goods. But as you can see in the gross profit line, the gross profit basically in the first half was flat yet it was better in just the second quarter, but again, I prefer the longer time frame.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, against the question, will expansion of new categories cause the compression of the gross profit margin, we had previously said yes, it might be a little, but it will be offset by productivity. What you've seen in the first half is it's a wash. We've been able to drive the Coke franchise and the innovation and manage the portfolio such that the net impact on gross margin is a wash, which is a great result. And then obviously, we're getting some flow-through of our ongoing productivity efforts. Just because we haven't announced the new program, we are still focused on using resources effectively in the SG&amp;A on the back -- in the back office and investing wisely with the marketing such that this operating leverage is flowing through into the margin. So, I think the game plan is intact and we're continuing to drive against it.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Judy Hong</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, James, I guess, my question is just kind of looking at the coffee and Energy opportunity, and you've laid out the plans for the year in entering some of the newer markets. I guess my question is how do you determine and so what's the criteria in determining which markets to enter as kind of the Phase 1 and then over the next couple of years? And then I think Ali asked about a question about if the U.S. fits into that plan so if you can address that as well.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. I mean just starting on the U.S., I mean we haven't -- the markets we haven't announced yet, I mean, we're not going to announce until we're ready. Clearly, we're thinking about the U.S. market and when would be the right timing for Coke Energy. Clearly, it's a big market and a big opportunity. I think, ultimately, the way I would look at it is we've launched in a number of markets and our approach is essentially to launch in markets where we know we have capabilities and a lot of strength and a strong Coke franchise, and therefore, we think would represent a robust good opportunity and that should give us an idea of what -- how well we could do. So, Spain would be an example of that. We have a great franchise in Spain. We have a great on-premise business there with the cafés and restaurants. We have strong relationships with the modern trade and a very strong bottler. So, we know that if we do well there, that in strong markets, then we know what that would represent.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Then we've also launched it in some of the other emerging markets and some markets that our strengths are not as good as the Spanish end of the spectrum, but it'll give us a range of learnings and experience in different types of environments. And that'll give us, in a way, a set of learnings on the 1.0 of launching Coke Energy from which we can learn. And purely from a rollout perspective and a tactical perspective in something like this, it would probably suit us to have those learnings and have a 2.0 for the U.S., whatever tweaks that may be, whether it's taking the formulation tweaks and the graphic tweaks and the marketing mix tweaks and the execution approach, because it's all about accelerating the learning cycle and driving that forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So that will be the conceptual approach on how we want to get it done. And that's kind of will be true, whether it's Coke Energy or Coke with coffee. Every time we've done it, we've tried to make sure we learn from the cycle of the 1.0 or 2.0 before we go to the next set of countries. Obviously, that means you need to go back at some point to the initial countries to bring them up to the latest thinking on what can be done.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And similarly, for coffee, there, of course, we're looking at which of the formats best establishes the brand and can work. And clearly, we think that rolling out with the express vending machines and being a kind of a beans-and-machines beverage partner to the restaurants and cafés and the kind of immediate consumption channels is the way to a kind of drive the brand forward. And ready-to-drink coffee will play a part of that but not necessarily be the first piece.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Nik Modi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">James, I was hoping you can just give us some context on the U.S. market. Obviously, the sparkling business is doing quite well. But maybe you could just talk about the still portfolio. I understand there's some kind of gaps and weakness in that portfolio when it comes to the DASANI, POWERADE, Gold Peak. So maybe you can just kind of talk about those brands and kind of what the plans are there to get them back in the right direction.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. I mean, I think, again, I'll talk more about the first half than the second quarter because, of course, you get things bouncing around in the short term. I think on the side where there's more work to be done, the water brands, the mainstream water brands like DASANI we're under pressure a bit so far this year as much as anything due to the expansion of retailer private labels and particularly in the larger formats of number of bottles in a case. So, there's some challenge there.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">The flip side of that is we continue to do really well with the premium water brands. So, Topo Chico continued its fantastic growth wave, smartwater continued to grow. So, I think you see a diverging set of performance in the water market between the mainstream and the premium water brands.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">POWERADE, again a bit of Tale of Two Cities. POWERADE, the main brand, has not had a good start to the year, faced some executional issues yet POWERADE Zero's growing, and I know the BODYARMOR is doing well in the Coke system. So again, a bit Tale of Two Cities in the sports drink’s category.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">In terms of juice, again, it's a bit of a repeat. Minute Maid was flat, slightly soft, but we did really well in some of the new launches. And Simply was growing nicely. So again, I think you see a bit of that contrast between some of the mainstream, in this case, more flattish or slightly negative and growing in the premium, especially off Simply and the smoothie. So, I think you see a little of a dichotomy going on there.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And I think it's worth talking about the second half. We really got a good program going into the back half of the year, a lot of focus on media and experiential sampling on some of those still categories whether it's smartwater or POWERADE or Gold Peak and some agreed commercial activities with specific customers and market blitzes on merchandising as to kind of bring those back around. So, I think we'll see a lot of attention and focus on reverting some of those trends going into the back half of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Caroline Levy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">James, it would be really helpful if you could sort of walk us around the world. You did mention a bit of softness in Mexico if I'm not mistaken, and you said Brazil was stable even though you did better. And if you just looked at the state of consumer and the friendliness towards U.S. companies with China specifically being part of that question, could you just talk to us a little bit about how you see that around the globe? What's getting significantly better? And if anything's deteriorating? Is the Middle East getting worse, for example?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So just going back to -- starting in Latin America where you mentioned -- the Mexico that I mentioned, the little softness in the economy, Mexico, we still grew volume in the second quarter slightly, but we still grew volume in the second quarter in Mexico. So, I think it's more of a generalized concern of the environment. Brazil obviously did well. The Argentinian business suffered again in the second quarter. I think there's a clear macroeconomic environment. We're very focused on what we can do in terms of affordability and execution, but you can't completely outrun a macro crisis. So, we're definitely seeing some of that. So, Argentina was very weak.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Middle East, yes, that was negative. Clearly, there's some struggle there across the Middle East and that was negative in the quarter. But then once you get out of that, I think it's a bit kind of the theme of the year, which is the clouds on the horizon don't quite arrive with the storm or the storm doesn't arrive. So yes, when you read the reports and look at the forecasts and listen to the news, you would conclude that things are worse. But there seems to be some calm underneath of that and I think that's what we're seeing. As we've executed against our plan, the macros have not been as bad perhaps as one had feared and that has allowed us to deliver strong operational results, and I think Asia Pacific is one of the examples of that where we continue to do well across a broad number of countries on the basis of great plans.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Kevin Grundy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Congratulations on strong first half results. James, a question on North America. So broadly, three consecutive quarters where volumes have been negative but not very consistent with the industry with pricing that's been put into place. But I guess the other key topic, of course, is that your key competitors ramped investment spending that started last year. This is continuing behind key brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Arguably, to some degree, the strategic changes that they're making in North America will really be sort of a key watch point for investors whether this turnaround is, indeed, going to be successful. So broadly, if you could discuss sort of the competitive environment. And then the second part of that, whether you're comfortable with current investment levels in your portfolio going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I mean, firstly, I think I would say that if competitors are investing in the category behind branding and rational pricing and trying to create value, that is ultimately good news. Yes, it means we have to be on the top of our game, but it's better to be in an industry where there's more consumer demand being created than not. So, I think that's a very important starting point that we think will be beneficial ultimately to the total beverage business in the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">In terms of the volume, I mean, the volume was slightly negative in the U.S. I think it's important to remember what we're trying to do in the U.S. business. We're focused on building the consumer engagement, and so a lot of what we've done, particularly in some of the sparkling brands, is have a focus on some of the smaller packages and drive for transaction growth even if that means the volume's flat. We'd love a little bit of positive. But if it's a little bit of negative, that hasn't concerned us because we think we can stabilize the volume in the long term and have the value be created ultimately through the price/mix. So, more price versus volume. Obviously, like to see volume a little bit positive in the case of the U.S., but really sticking with the strategy of driving the consumer interactions, heavy lean on smaller packages. Of course, the portfolio piece that goes with that is some of the Zero Sugars and the reformulation.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">I think that's what you see turning into the strong revenue growth rates from North America. So, you're seeing North America do consistently over time well in terms of revenue growth, and they're gaining market share across a broad swathe of categories from sparkling to a number of the still categories.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, we think it's a strategy that's working for us. We think the investment levels are good for what we're seeing at the moment. Of course, we constantly review all aspects of the business mix and the variables we control as well especially, and we will go up or down as we believe to be appropriate and necessary.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Sean King</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">A question about the expanded launch of alcoholic beverages in Japan. While I recognize there might be market-specific competitor or maybe demographic considerations, why not look to other markets besides Japan?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Well, clearly, this one evades a very Japanese logic we talked about when it launched regionally. The competitive set, we can face a set of local competitors in Japan, which operate in a multicategory, not just soft drinks and sparkling and stills, but wine, beer and spirits going to the same customers, and in the case of the Lemon-Do, competing for an occasion and a consumer which heavily overlaps here. So, there's a lot of logic in the context of the Japanese business and what you're seeing is a horizontal distribution expansion in the Japanese business, still very small in the context even our business in Japan.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">The logic of taking it elsewhere has not been clear for The Coca-Cola Company. Of course, historically, our bottlers have carried beer or been brewers so that in parts of the world where there's some distribution logic that it has been -- there have been relationships with our bottling partners. But the Japanese -- example where we own the brand is the Japanese example, and anything else would need to be considered very carefully and the business logic would be very clear for why we should do something different.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Bonnie Herzog</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">All right. I actually wanted to circle back to your full year guidance. Obviously, your results so far this year were better than you originally expected given that you increased your top line guidance. So, could you maybe highlight or summarize for us the main drivers of this or essentially what was an upside surprise from your perspective? And then on the second half, comps are still tough, but could you highlight why you expect your organic sales to grow a point or two? Are you just being conservative with your outlook for the back half?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure. Look, the story I think ultimately follows the trajectory. We had, have and still have going forward a clear strategy with a strong view on what we need to do to capture the opportunity ahead of us, and we started executing that a number of years ago. And we were getting momentum and -- we were getting momentum coming out of '17. We had good result, top line momentum in '18.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We did at the beginning of this year like our plans still, but see the macro clouds on the horizon and we're a little more cautious in our guidance in February from a top line point of view. The clouds, as we've talked about, are still there, but the storm never arrived. And so, we did better in the first half. I mean, ultimately, it's a result of executing the right plans and the right place and the headwinds not being there.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, where have we seen the benefit? I think we've seen the benefit across a whole series of places doing that a little bit better, whether it's Asia Pacific or some of the parts of Europe and Africa. So, I think it's the flow-through of execution, but it just wasn't one place. As I talked about on the first question, I really do think of the first half more as a 5 than a 6 and there are lots of ways of getting at that answer whether you like the simple rule of thumb or just taking the average of the unit cases and the average of the price/mix and that gets you five, whether it's two quarters or four quarters or you can get into the minutia or the detail on the timing of the Brexit, gallons and all this sort of stuff. But ultimately, you come to the simple headline answer that it's basically a 5, and it's a 5 cycling other growth rates. So, there's really good momentum there.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then when you count the second half, the clouds are still there. The storm hasn't arrived. We have great plans. We have a strategy and a bottling system with momentum. And so, we think we can see our way through to delivering an underlying five in the second half. Of course, if those timing elements reversed, the reported numbers are going to be slightly softer than that in the second half. But that won't detract from the ultimate conclusion that it's a system that's creating momentum around five with a plan that's working.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Japan because in the commentary so far that you've offered on Asia, you really highlighted developing and emerging markets. And I think there were supply chain issues in Japan last year that we would have been cycling through. So, if you can just run through kind of what's doing in Japan and why that wasn't called out as being a stronger contributor.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Quincey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure. No, Japan was a detractor there in this quarter and for some very specific reasons. Firstly, in the natural disasters last year, one of our important bottling -- one of the important manufacturing facilities of our bottle was knocked out completely last year. So, we lost capacity just as we were starting to grow in the Japanese business, and they're working very hard to install new capacity. They're doing a great job in doing it, but one cannot defeat the laws of physics. And so that's going to be brought online over the course of this year, and that has produced a constraint on the business this year.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The second reason, which is super important, is we have taken a pretty broad price increase in Japan in April, the first one in a couple of decades. So that's a big deal. And whilst our competitors did not follow us immediately, they did follow us by the end of the quarter. So of course, there was -- the price of leadership in those circumstances is we suffered a little bit of a volume hit in the second quarter. But of course, as they've gone up, too, we think that, that will normalize. And in the context of capacity constraint, we deprioritized some of the lower-margin water volume.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, some very specific reasons in Japan, but we are focused on making the right decisions to invest and drive the brand going into the future. We've got some improving trends in the vending channel. We've got some product innovation and some packaging and pricing stuff -- more stuff coming through with the digital platform as well. So, we think that these decisions will allow us to start to really get some better results in Japan as the production comes back on track -- production capacity comes back on track as we go into the second half of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, we see it more as -- much more as a point in time, but we believe it was what was needed to be done given the natural disasters and it's the right decisions in terms of setting the business up for the future.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Grant O'Brien</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just want to touch on free cash flow a little bit. Obviously, you guys are focused on it a little bit more. I understand some of that is timing year-to-date. But just wondering on some of the changes you guys have made and maybe some of the initiatives in place going forward to improve free cash flow conversion and kind of room to run on that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks. Yes, this is a key area of focus and we've talked about it over the last few months as being such, and there's a number of elements to improving our position as we go forward. One is in the area of working capital. We know that we can do better. We know we have opportunity to -- between where we sit today and where best-in-class is. And in this quarter, we made significant strides with -- in the payables arena, we've delivered almost $600 million of benefits to our working capital number in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">A second area that we've talked about is reducing the amount of onetime cash outflows that have been a key part of the transformation work, particularly with the refranchising in North America. That number is going to decline as we move forward and we saw a little bit of that impacting us in -- favorably in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And the third area then would be to get our CapEx, capital expenditures, in line with what we think the run rate should be going forward. That's going to take a little bit longer given the fact that we have taken back for the time being the Philippines and South Africa. And so, in the second quarter, in addition to the working capital improvements, the benefits from timing of cash tax payments in 2018, we did not have them this year. And our capital expenditure flow for the year is weighted more in the back half.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So good progress on working capital, some timing benefits in the quarter. But as we look to the second half of the year, we are very confident that we'll deliver the free cash flow guidance that we've given.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Crédit Suisse.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Kaumil Gajrawala</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Well done this quarter, everybody. I guess first on two things. One on Coke Energy now that it's been in the market for a little bit. Can you give us some context on source of volume? Is it really coming from Red Bull as I think you guys have mentioned? And then is any of the growth coming from outside of Energy? And then the second question, John, I don't remember your words exactly, but I believe you said you felt the dollars coming to the end of a strong cycle, and I'm just curious if there's something you're seeing that you could provide to help us kind of understand that comment.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Sure. Let me start with the second point. When you take a step back and you look at dollar cycles over the last 20 or 30 years, the current cycle is the longest one we've had, number one. And when you look at the -- both the macro indicators over the next 12 to 24 months plus some of the political commentary that has been in play around the world, it does point to us being at the high end of dollar strength. And hence, my comments on the environment as we look at it today based on both spot rates and the outlook that we see through a number of lenses to be a benign environment in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>James Quincey</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you, everyone. Just to summarize again, bottling system is working very hard with us. We're aligned. We're delivering improved execution. We're seeing strong performance across our collective business. And we're making good progress not just in the near-term, but for our long-term goals. So as always, thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us today. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.</p>]"

I'd also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Moving to slide 3. Let me start first by summarizing the solid progress we have made on our major growth plans along with other noteworthy accomplishments. Neil will go into more detail after my remarks, but I wanted to take a few moments to touch on some key highlights.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">For the first half of the year, we've made good progress on our growth plans. The fundamentals and long-term demand growth that underpin our investments remain strong. The competitive advantages we've built into our projects make them robust across commodity price cycles including the margin environment we are currently experiencing.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We reached final investment decisions for nine major strategic projects in just the first six months of the year including projects from all three business lines. Offshore exploration success continued with four significant deepwater discoveries; three in Guyana and one in Cyprus and we achieved key milestones in the development of two of our LNG growth projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Liquids production increased significantly from last year with volumes up 144,000 barrels per day or 7% driven by strong growth in the Permian. We remain on schedule with plans to increase production in the Permian to 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024, as we also continue to build-out supporting infrastructure and takeaway capacity.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, recent projects startups in North America and Europe are already making a positive contribution to results. These projects are accretive to earnings even in the current margin environment demonstrating the market resiliency we envisioned when making these investments. In particular, the Baytown steam cracker, which started up last year has performed exceptionally well with production exceeding design capacity by 10%.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Lastly, we increased the quarterly dividend by 6% marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Positive momentum we generated in the first half of the year is in line with the plans we laid out in 2018 and reiterated in March and positions us very well to generate long-term shareholder value.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I'll now highlight our second quarter financial performance starting on slide 4. Earnings were $3.1 billion in the quarter or $0.73 per share including a positive $0.12 per share impact from a tax rate change in Alberta, Canada. These results were in line with our expectations given the margin environment, seasonal impacts and planned maintenance we experienced during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The margin environment remained challenging in the second quarter as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and industry product margins. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6 billion in the quarter. After adjusting for changes in working capital, which were primarily seasonal in nature and consistent. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">CapEx for the quarter was $8 billion and through the first half of the year CapEx is $15 billion representing 50% of the full year guidance we provided in March. The free cash flow deficit in the second quarter is a result of our strategy focused on the long-term and grow shareholder value across commodity cycles leveraging our financial capacity.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I'll now go through a more detailed view of developments since the first quarter on the next slide. Starting first with the Upstream. Average crude oil prices were higher than the first quarter with Brent up $5.63 and WTI up $4.93. ExxonMobil's liquids realizations increased by $5.09 in line with the increase in crude markers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Gas realizations on the other hand were down in the second quarter. This was consistent with the typical three month to six month crude-linked LNG pricing lag that we experienced and a $0.51 decline in Henry Hub pricing as production growth continues to outpace demand in the U.S</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Gas realizations were also impacted by weaker prices in Europe with lower seasonal demand and an increase in LNG imports. Production in the Permian averaged 274,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 21% relative to the first quarter. Permian production is up nearly 90% from the average production we saw in the second quarter of last year. In addition, the three exploration discoveries in Guyana in the first half of the year, we recently completed construction of the FPSO for Liza Phase 1, Liza Destiny which is now in transit to Guyana.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also made a final investment decision for the 220,000 barrel per day Liza Phase 2 project and we updated the resource estimate to more than 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels. We also progressed toward a final investment decision for the Mozambique LNG project by securing approval of Rovuma development plan from the Mozambique government. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">We announced plans to expand unconventional operations in Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin and expanded our growing Deepwater exploration portfolio including the acquisition of 7 million deepwater exploration acres offshore Namibia.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the Downstream, industry refining margins improved during the quarter, but remained near five-year lows. Unrelated reliability events at the Baytown, Sarnia and Yanbu refineries negatively impacted second quarter results. We expanded our Group II lubricant base stocks portfolio with increased production from the Rotterdam hydrocracker and a further expansion in Singapore.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Although, long-term fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business, Paraxylene margins weakened during the second quarter as a result of supply length from recent industry capacity additions. We achieved another important milestone in our plans to grow high-value premium Chemical product sales with the startup of the polyethylene expansion at Beaumont, which will capture integration benefits with the Baytown steam cracker. And once lined out it's expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the current margin environment.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also announced a final investment decision for the Gulf Coast growth venture in Corpus Christi where with our partner SABIC we will construct a 1.8 million ton per year steam cracker and derivative units.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We continue to progress research and development of lower emissions technologies. In the quarter, we signed a joint development agreement with Global Thermostat to advance breakthrough technology to capture and concentrate carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources including power plants.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We also initiated a partnership with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory to research and develop a range of lower emissions technologies with a specific focus on ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and storage to commercial scale. Both of these important efforts are aligned with our focus on leveraging fundamental science to develop breakthrough solutions that can help reduce global emissions.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let's now move to Slide 6 for an overview of second quarter earnings relative to the first quarter of the year. Second quarter earnings of $3.1 billion were up nearly $800 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were up approximately $400 million driven by higher liquids realizations and onetime tax items, partly offset by lower natural gas prices.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Downstream earnings increased by more than $700 million due to improved fuels margins, wider North American crude differentials, and the absence of negative mark-to-market derivative impacts. Improvements in Downstream earnings were partly offset by the previously mentioned reliability events. And finally Chemical earnings were lower by $330 million with higher scheduled maintenance and weaker paraxylene margins.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to Slide 7, I'll expand on the impressive year-over-year increase in Upstream volumes. Production in the second quarter of 2019 was 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of more than 260,000 oil equivalent barrels per day relative to the second quarter of last year representing a 7% increase.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The higher volume was driven by production growth of 129,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian which represents an 89% increase than the prior year quarter. Increased production from Hebron and Kaombo also contributed to the higher volumes.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Lower maintenance in Canada, and the absence of impacts from the earthquake in Papua New Guinea, combined with stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe, provided additional volume uplift.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The bottom left chart highlights the strong year-over-year liquids growth of 177,000 barrels per day, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of 2018. Importantly, this marks the highest quarterly liquids production since 2016 and the highest second quarter liquids production in a decade.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Moving to Slide 8, I'll review the second quarter of 2019 cash flow. Second quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes of working capital yielded $6 billion in cash flow from operating activities. There was a $1.2 billion draw on working capital in the quarter, driven primarily by lower seasonal payables. This impact is in line with a typical seasonal pattern of a working capital draw in the second quarter which has been on average about $2 billion over the last decade.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Other items included the impact from the Alberta tax rate change which resulted in a noncash benefit to earnings of approximately $500 million. While no significant asset sales have completed year-to-date, asset marketing activities are in line with our divestment plans and consistent with our expectation of generating $15 billion from asset sales by the end of 2021.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Second quarter additions to PP&amp;E and net investments and advances were $6.9 billion, driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian basin. Gross debt increased by approximately $4 billion in the quarter and cash ended the quarter at $4.2 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As I have discussed and as you can see we are leveraging our financial capacity to invest in advantaged value accretive projects through the commodity price cycle. This is an important element of our strategy, so let me provide some additional perspective on the next slide.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The chart at the top left of the page provides a view of commodity prices and margins over the past 10 years and the relative position of the environment we've seen in the first half of 2019 to that range.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">While margins so far this year have been on the low end of the 10-year range across many of our businesses these levels are consistent with historical experience and importantly, consistent with the scenarios that we anticipate when we make investment decisions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In fact even in today's market environment as mentioned the recent Chemical and refining project startups that I recently highlighted are contributing positive earnings and cash flow. The cyclical nature of these businesses makes it critically important to have the financial capacity to invest across commodity price cycles and grow the dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Over the past several years we've taken advantage of these downturns and commodity prices to assemble the best set of opportunities that we've had in 20 years and we are now investing consistent with our strategy to capture value from those opportunities. This combination of financial capacity to invest through the cycle and a deep portfolio of attractive investments is unique in the industry.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The chart on the bottom left of the page highlights our annual free cash flow generation over the past several years. Cumulative free cash flow over this time period is well in excess of our cumulative dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">This provided a strong basis to make value accretive investments and grow the dividend over time. And we view those two efforts as being closely linked together. The ability to grow the dividend requires continued investments in accretive, resilient opportunities across price cycles.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">During times of price volatility, we keep the long term in mind as there can be a number of opportunities to capture incremental value by investing when others are pulling back. With our financial strength and a competitively advantaged portfolio we've been able to invest counter-cyclically in a number of key growth areas taking advantage of attractive low-cost environments.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">I'll now provide some perspective on our outlook for the third quarter starting on slide 10. In the Upstream, we expect volumes in the third quarter to be in line with the second quarter. We will also see the impact of the absence of the second quarter onetime non-U.S. tax help of approximately $500 million.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the Downstream, we expect Permian crude differentials to narrow as additional takeaway capacity comes online. Industry refining margins are expected to be in line with seasonal demand patterns. Scheduled maintenance in the third quarter should be significantly lower relative to the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure, as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions. Consistent with the Downstream, scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the third quarter is also expected to be lower. And I'll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance on the next slide.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As we've previously discussed, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream this year will be higher than normal, in part due to preparation for IMO 2020. Planned maintenance and downtime tends to be seasonal, in line with demand patterns. And consistent with this, we expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the third quarter to be lower relative to what we experienced in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And then in the fourth quarter, we anticipate maintenance activity to pick up as we enter into the fall maintenance season, but activity again should remain below second quarter levels. The estimated earnings impacts for the third and fourth quarter for the Downstream are shown on the upper left chart.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the Chemical business, shown on the bottom left chart, we also expect lower scheduled maintenance, with the impact in the third and fourth quarters below what we saw in the second quarter. We hope this provides you with some helpful perspectives on key drivers of anticipated market and planned factors for the upcoming quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And with that, at this time, I'd like to hand it over to Neil.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Neil Chapman</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Good morning everyone. It's good to be back on the call. As Neil said, before we take your questions, I'd like to share my perspective on the second quarter results, then I'm going to provide a few updates to the plans that we laid out in our New York March discussions.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I want to start by acknowledging the strong liquids growth. As I said many times, volume is not a target. It is an outcome of our plans to grow value. Nevertheless, our liquids growth reflects well on the organization maintaining the schedule in the early stages of executing our Upstream growth plans.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In terms of those growth plans, the ones we laid out in New York, I feel we're making outstanding progress. Permian growth is strong and on schedule. Guyana project plans are on or slightly ahead of schedule. And in the Downstream and Chemicals, 11 of the 19 projects that we laid out in New York last year are online and we FID-ed another six in the second quarter, going to provide some further details on these in the following slides.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We are in a unique position versus the rest of industry. We have a very attractive opportunity set. These are the advantaged projects that are robust at the bottom of the cycle conditions. So we have a very attractive opportunity set and we have the financial capacity to pursue them in a business that is very cyclical.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In the second quarter, three of our major businesses were at low points in their cycles. As you heard from Neil, that's been a major factor on our quarterly results. While we obviously prefer margins to be at the top of the cycle, the current margin scenario was contemplated and we have the financial capacity to maintain our plans. In fact, we've built our growth strategies, based on a full range of potential industry margins and the impact they would have on our financial results. That is why we put such importance on having a strong balance sheet to enable us to proceed with our long-term investment plans and weather through the cyclical nature of our business.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On a whole our businesses performed extremely well during the second quarter, actually they have in the first half of the year. Chemicals and Upstream reliability has been excellent and refining has also been strong with the exception of the three discrete incidents. The one in Sarnia, Canada; one in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; and the one in Baytown, Texas that Neil referenced.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Although, these are one-offs, they're not systemic to our overall performance. In total, we estimate the second quarter impact from these three instances to be of the tune of $150 million of earnings, that's the earnings impact. Of course, this is disappointing. Baytown and the Yanbu facility are now back in full production and Sarnia will be at marginally lower rates through the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I want to take this opportunity to update you on the fire that occurred at our Baytown olefins plant earlier this week. First and foremost is the safety of our people and those in the surrounding community. I'm pleased to say, there were no reported serious injuries. An investigation into the cause of the incident and the potential damage continues. And frankly at this stage, it's really too early to say much more than that.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the larger point of reliability, of course, it's an important focus area for us. It has been for a long time. We benchmark extensively and our Downstream facilities are ranked consistently better than the industry average. However, we must eliminate the significant one-off events, as we're just not satisfied with being an above average industry performer.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We're progressing a comprehensive reliability improvement program that we initiated late last year. This is leveraging insights across our Upstream, Refining and Chemical businesses and it's also reaching out to leaders outside of our industry to ensure that we leave no stone unturned in our drive to lead industry reliability at all times.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Slide 14 summarizes the progress of our major portfolio. Starting with the Upstream, I'm going to provide some more details on Permian and Guyana on the subsequent following pages. In Brazil, our Carcara development is proceeding on schedule. We expect to spud the first exploration well on Uirapuru and that's the block that's adjacent to Carcara with our partner Petrobras in the second half of this year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We passed two significant milestones with host government approvals of our development plans for the Papua LNG in Papua New Guinea and Rovuma in Mozambique. In the Downstream, our three investments at Beaumont, Rotterdam and Antwerp these are all upgrading low-value streams to high-value streams, they're lined out and all are contributing to earnings and cash. And in the second quarter, we completed the FID of the three remaining major refinery projects that are in our growth plans.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In Chemicals, you the new Baytown cracker and two polyethylene plants are performing well, and the expansion of the high-margin thermoplastic elastomer business in Santoprene started up in May of this year. All these investments are also accretive to current earnings.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We started up the third polyethylene plant at Beaumont in July and that was one month ahead of schedule. We also completed the FIDs of four major new world-scale plants in the first half three of which were in the second quarter. At the new polypropylene line at Baton Rouge, our linear alpha olefins plant at Baytown that will be a new product to ExxonMobil's Chemical portfolio and expansion to our industry-leading high-margin propylene plastomer business at Vistamaxx, which is also at Baytown and the largest steam cracker that we have ever built plus the derivatives at Corpus Christi.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">On slide 15, you can see that our unconventional Permian and Bakken volumes are growing in line with plan. We increased our Permian volumes by 20% in the second quarter, which is up 90% versus the second quarter last year. We're now at 51 rigs and 12 frac crews in the Permian and we brought 67 wells to sales in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our unique development plans which are focused on maximizing long-term value of the resource and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil to drive capital efficiency are delivering encouraging results. The rocks and well performance is extremely strong. And as I said previously our approach is to understand the impact of development and operating practices on both IP rates and long-term recovery. Drilling a single well and applying a larger completion with higher intensity fracture can yield higher IPs, but it may yield lower ultimate recovery versus drilling several wells with less intense completions.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Capital efficiency is critical and it's an area where our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. It's all about balancing capital outlay IPs and the ultimate recovery to achieve the highest value. We've ramped up activity above surface with the ongoing construction of our Cowboy Central Delivery Point facilities in the Poker Lake region of the Delaware. And we finalized the FID to proceed with the greater than one million barrel a day liquids pipeline to the Gulf Coast. The Permian level activity is high and we're making great progress.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Page 16, our first FPSO Liza Destiny is en route to Guyana. We started the schedule for the first quarter of next year, but I'm optimistic we'll do better than that. We completed the FID on the second FPSO at Liza-2, which is close to double the size of Liza-1 in the second quarter and that will start up in 2022. The startup of the third FPSO for the Payara and Pacora development remains on schedule for 2023 startup.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We've had three further discoveries in the first half of 2019 Haimara, Tilapia and Yellowtail. We're continuing to assess the results of these discoveries and are not yet ready to finalize their resource size. However, the Stabroek resource will be 6-plus billion oil-equivalent barrels and again as I've said before this resource continues to grow.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We anticipate three further exploration wells in the second half. They are likely to include Tripletail Uaru and Maku with a potential fourth one to spud before year-end. We currently have three drillships in the basin, and the fourth will be on station in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left, we've included a chart to illustrate the continuing increase in our inventory of future exploration prospects.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I've included page 17 to remind you about Upstream divestment plans through 2021. We've previously communicated that we anticipate asset sales of $15 billion. As I said before, the $15 billion is a risk number and anticipate that some of the divestment candidates that we put in the market will not realize our retention value. But the marketing program is on track and includes the assets listed on the right. We're also in marketing discussions in other assets that are not public, so I have not of course listed them here. Again, this program is on schedule and we anticipate delivering the $15 billion previously communicated.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Finally on slide 18, a quick update on the significant growth milestones in our integrated ethylene and polyethylene business on the Gulf Coast. The Baytown and Mont Belvieu investments have been aligned for some time. And as I said earlier, are accretive to earnings even at the current low margins. The polyethylene units at Mont Belvieu started up in 2017 and are operating at capacity. The ethylene steam cracker at Baytown, which started up last year is operating at 10% above design capacity.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">The third polyethylene line at Beaumont started up in July ahead of schedule. This was the first line in the world to start up on the higher value, but notoriously difficult to produce in a gas phase reactor metallocene polyethylene and that was from the first day of operations. We're very pleased that our startup was flawless.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In the second quarter, we completed the FID of the largest steam cracker we will ever build, plus the derivatives and they're going to be located in Corpus with our partner SABIC. This will be highly advantaged versus the industry Gulf Coast investments based on location, and of course the adjacency to the Permian lower capital costs and high-value products.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Startup is scheduled for 2022. The fundamentals supporting these Chemical investments remain strong. All of this is being done to what we know will be increasing global demand supported by population growth and the growing middle class.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In summary, our organization is absolutely focused on delivering the operating performance we expect to-date and on delivering our growth plans. We have a high level of confidence that we will deliver and our performance through the first half of this year demonstrates that we're on track.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And with that, Neil I'll hand back to you for Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Neil Hansen</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Great. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for your comments, Neil. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have.</p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-And-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Mr. Chapman and Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Neil great to have you back on the call. Neil, I've got two questions, if I may. My first one not to be terribly predictable but – is on Guyana. Clearly, the exploration program Hammerhead you've dedicated both assets to appraisal drilling. I know you're – as I understand it from your partner you're going off to kind of fully appraise what could be a major development hub in the Longtail Turbot area.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So I just wonder, if I could just push you a little bit on why you have not yet chosen to revisit the likely production trajectory, because it clearly looks like you are running well ahead not least because to have a fourth and fifth boat and still had 750 means those would be undersized. So just could you frame for us what you see the potential like today on how that would play into on your 2025 outlook which is clearly out of date?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, a bit out of date. You know, it's -- what we communicated in March was this big increase getting up to 750 KBD by that time. I would tell you, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the basin. I want to start at that point.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">As we said, we have the first boat on the way. We have the second boat in construction. We have three drillships. We have a tremendous amount of activity going on. And all of these items -- we're going at a great, great pace. We have to get up -- maintain alignment with our partners and with the government on each one.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">What I'm really focused on and the organization is focused on primarily is delivering on what we communicated to you and to the investment community. And that's the numbers we laid out in March. Of course, as I indicated, there are some -- we're very optimistic that that will be at least what we will do. We're just not ready to make another change to up either the production outlook or at this stage anything more on the resource base.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">You mentioned Hammerhead. Let me just make a couple of comments on Hammerhead. I think you are aware that we drilled two more wells on Hammerhead recently and the results were positive. I would describe them as reinforcing the high-quality reservoirs. We've now drilled three wells in Hammerhead. They're in communication, the press is in communication, which means there's very good connectivity which again suggests that there's good news at development planning.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">You talked about appraisal drilling. You know, we're going to be doing some appraisal drilling on Ranger, which we've not quantified yet. That's the large carbonate structure, of course. All of that being said, we just have a tremendous amount of activity going on. I want the organization focused on delivering what we've committed to. And frankly, the next significant update in terms of outlook for production, I don't think we'll give anything different until an update in March next year.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Well, I can obviously -- well, I didn't want to be impertinent by saying out of date, so let me just clarify what I meant. When you first gave the 2025 target, the guidance was 500,000 barrels a day. It's now more than 750,000 and you still haven't changed the 2020. I know it's a long way away, but that was my point.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But my follow-up Neil is probably a little bit an off the ball question, kind of related to the disposal pace on the kind of the use of proceeds. My understanding is that you recently conducted a study with a buy side on opinions on share buybacks return of cash to shareholders and how you would -- how you might consider that in the future perhaps even with a potential to lean on the balance sheet.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to what was behind that the reason for that survey and whether you're still comfortable with the pace of the disposal program you laid out at the Analyst Day. Now, I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yeah. I mean again, Neil can maybe make a comment in a second, on the specifics of the survey. Let me just make some comments on the disposal program. We highlighted $15 billion. I told the investment community that was a risk number. In other words, I anticipate we'll have to put more in the market to achieve that number. We're on track with that. I would tell you we're -- we communicated that in March.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We're just four months into a three-month program. And so -- a three-year program rather. And we're on track with the marketing. What we said, at that time, was in terms of our capital allocation that there's no change in the priority continuous -- our use of cash use of capital starts with investing with value-accretive projects.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Secondly, we're going to maintain our growing dividend. We want to maintain our financial flexibility and then we'll look at how else -- what else we do with the cash in terms of buybacks. And that's the way, I think we have discussed it for many years and we'll reinforce that in March.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Of course, we indicated then that with $15 billion on the planning basis that could result in returning some cash to the shareholders. But we will look at that as that cash comes in, and we'll set that based on the market conditions at the time. Neil, do you want to talk about the survey?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. No, again just as Neil mentioned, the discussions we've had with a few buy-side firms, I wouldn't classify it as a survey. We certainly reach out to them to talk about how you might execute a buyback program. It wasn't intended to get a different perspective on our capital allocation priority, which as Neil mentioned, remain the same. It was more to gain a perspective from a few buy-side firms on -- if you execute buybacks what's the best approach to do that, what's the philosophy you should take. But again, Doug, I wouldn't classify this as a survey. It was a discussion with a handful of the buy-side firms of some of our larger shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Understood. Appreciate the answers guys, and thanks again for getting on Neil.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. Thanks, Doug.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Next we'll go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Terreson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, everybody. Neil financial results in the first half of 2019 seem to be tracking below the plan highlighted at Analyst Day for 2020. Although the company made clear at the time that those projections were predicated upon flat Brent rail and flat Downstream and Chemical margins too. So my question is when adjusting for market factors and whatever else you may deem appropriate, are you still comfortable with the 11% return on capital employed and $25 billion annual earnings figures for 2020? And if so, what factors will help bridge the gap from the first half 2019 actuals to the full year 2020 projections? Or do you think we'll get there solely from normalization of the market factors that Neil mentioned on page 9 in his opening comments?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. What Neil is -- I – again, we got -- we have Neil’s quiet here of course, but if in doubt -- I'm -- this is Neil Chapman. I'm going to answer the question. Doug, I would say, remember when we laid out this plan in March 2018 what we were trying to indicate is the earnings power, the cash flow power that we're bringing into the business at constant prices and at flat margins. At that time, we said we did a flat $60 dollars a barrel and we do it for Chemicals and Downstream at 2017 actual margins and that was our intention.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And of course, we go back and skewered our performance. And I think that's what you're asking is how are we doing if you take away the price and margin impacts of the current earnings. I would say we're pretty much matching the plan. The significant -- the concern we've had of course has been these reliability events, particularly the ones that we’ve had in the Downstream.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Outside of the ones that we reported in the first and second quarter, there's nothing material that's changed from our plan that we laid out last year. It doesn't mean to say there aren't pluses and minuses. It doesn't mean to say we have some positive surprises and some negative surprises, I think that would be naive to say everything is absolutely perfect. But on average, I would suggest that we're pretty much tracking the plan, and there's no reason at this stage for us to adjust those outlooks that we laid out 18 months or so ago.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Terreson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. No, I realize its imperfect, but just wanted to try to get a gauge on it. So, thanks a lot.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Next we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning. My first question is about the Permian. The industry for a while now but maybe coming to a head here it seems to be having some issues with spacing and its impact on productivity. We don't have a lot of precise numbers about your spacing, but we do know that your development plan calls for -- call it a high concentration of lateral feet per square mile or they're just -- you have a lot of wells that are stacking up in your section.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So can you talk about just broadly this might be too complex a question. I don't want to get too esoteric, but just broadly how you're managing some of these issues we're seeing in the industry given the nature of your development plan in the Permian?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. Simon it’s -- of course, like you I read as many of the different results in the industry. I would tell you that in terms of our planning basis, again it's unchanged from the detailed plan that I laid out in March. And what I said at that time that we are driving a different approach than the industry with these really leveraging a combination of this large contiguous acreage that we've had and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil. And, of course, you will recall that I went through all of that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I also discussed at that time that we are working on plans that we'll develop and drill multiple horizontal benches at one time. Our feeling -- there is communication between these horizontal benches. And if you go in and drill one bench now and expect to come back years later and drill the other benches, we do see or we do believe there's communication between the benches and it should dissipate. And our belief is that drilling of multiple benches simultaneously in the approach that I laid out appears to be the right way to go.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We're at the very early stages of that. Frankly it's too early to highlight anything new from what I said back in March of last year. I am aware that there are competitors out there who've looked at spacing and have moved along a line of having closer spacing than we have in our plans. I have heard that. I think everybody in the industry has read about that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">My understanding is the company involved in that has pulled back from it. It hasn't been successful. We have not taken that approach. Our spacing is not as tight as that. So it's early days. We have nothing new to report versus what we said last time. As I said, we are on plan and nothing different.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay, thank you. That's helpful. We'll go back to the March materials. My follow-up is on Chemicals and it's sort of a macro question. And you highlighted that there's some margin headwinds in the industry right now due to capacity, but capacity continues to get sanctioned globally. There's FID in the face of this margin pressure.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And so I was wondering for your perspective on the demand side. Are you seeing a big pull for new supply in the petchem chain even with some capacity related margin headwinds now? And does that say anything about the longer term cycle and what your high-level views on the chem side are?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. Sam I would tell you that and again in Chemical just to break it down to the individual products, and of course we are heavily focused on ethylene and polyethylene and those are the margins that we typically talk about. And Neil highlighted the paraxylene business, but let me talk about ethylene and polyethylene because that's the major driver of our Chemical business.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Polyethylene demand grows at about 1.5 times GDP. And as I recall, the ethylene market is about 150 million tons globally. And so what that means is you need three to four new crackers per year just to meet demand, three to four worldscale crackers per year. Actually what we see right now is the demand remains very robust around the world. It's all driven by the growing middle class around the world. That's the driver for plastics, that's the driver for polyethylene. That middle-class having a high standard of living and that drives the assumption of polyethylene.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So actually globally we see the demand remaining very robust. There's no changes at all. What happened is there has been a glut of capacity. And so capacity is higher than demand. In the polyethylene business, unlike some of the other commodity businesses we're in, the demand sets it up relatively quickly.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now I will tell you that there are some further increments of capacity in ethylene and polyethylene to come online in the next year or so. So we don't see any change in the fundamentals at all.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">The glut in supply today is all because of these new capacity increments, most of which are on the Gulf Coast. So I think the short-term margins and if I was to try and predict short-term margins inevitably I would get it wrong, we do. But because of these extra increments of capacity that are coming on in the next 12 months, I would anticipate it to be pretty soft during that period.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now I've been in the chemical business for most of my career I think most of you know. And the Chemical business is notorious for coming back faster than anybody anticipates, but on a planning basis, I'd expect it to remain soft at least for the coming six months.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you so much.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey good morning. Good to talk to you Neil and Neil. So the first question I had was just around European gas. Obviously we've seen softness in global gas prices. Groningen is a smaller part of the business mix than it was a couple of years ago. But can you just frame out, how big that European gas is as a part of the business on a go-forward-basis? And is that a risk to profitability at the upstream -- of the upstream group?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. I mean I'll give you some approximate numbers here, Neil. I think in terms of volumes of gas in our portfolio, about 75% of our volumes from gas is what we call flowing gas, 25% is liquefied natural gas. And of that 75% flowing gas, about half is in the U.S. and half is in the European markets. I'm just going to break it down for you.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Of that European, about half is Groningen and half is a combination of as I remember roughly Germany, U.K. and Norway. So it's a relatively large part in terms of volume. It is not a relatively large part in terms of the earnings of our business.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">What I would tell you is the spot price as you've seen in LNG has dropped significantly, of course, over the last six months. Japanese, JK and market price plus the MVP price in Europe. And that's what's impacting the flowing gas prices. And what we have seen is we have seen continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia. That's been the growth driver over many years. It's just a little -- it's not as high for the six months of this year as it has been in the previous two years. I mean -- as I remember don't quote me these are approximate numbers.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">I believe year-to-date Asia LNG demand is up about 3% which is lower than it has been and the global demand or global supply of LNG is up north of 10%. So, what happens there, those cargoes look for a home and they can't find a home in Asia, they will get directed towards Europe that puts pressure on the European price. And if you look at the European gas business, the inventory level is quite high in Europe as well right now. That's what's putting the pressure on the spot LNG price and that's what's putting pressure on the flowing gas price.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">That's helpful Neil. I guess the follow-up is relative to even at the Analyst Day, Exxon's shares have outperformed your smaller independent competitors in places like the Permian. How do you think about the environment for M&amp;A and Exxon's role in consolidation in the Lower 48?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Well first of all, I'd tell you that, we're eyes wide open. We're always looking for opportunities. I mean -- and I think one of the reasons you maintain a strong balance sheet, it gives you that flexibility to act if you see something of value. I always start in the upstream with this. We have the strongest portfolio of opportunities this corporation has -- in the Upstream this corporation has had since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. In other words we don't need to do anything. I feel very, very comfortable with the growth plans that we have laid out to you and we see and we can execute through 2025 and beyond. So, we have the capacity to do something. We don't need to do anything from a business. What we need to do is execute our current set of opportunities. So, that's a great position to be in.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But we look all the time for value-added opportunities. So, I think that's a great part about looking at the portfolio. It's all a question of, if something is out there, which is competitive in our portfolio in other words, upgrades the portfolio and we can bring a competitive advantage versus industry. I mean that's the way we look at it.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">In the Lower 48, in the Permian specifically, I hear like you all hear a lot of chatter about potential consolidation down the road. But the market -- that will play out in the market. For us, what I like to say to our organization eyes wide open. If there's an opportunity out there, bring it forward. But I really want to make the point that we don't need to act. We don't believe we need to act right now. We have a great opportunity set as it is. Do you have anything to add here, Neil?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Well, I guess that's absolutely right, Neil. And given the portfolio that we have, we can be patient, we can be opportunistic and if we do see an opportunity to bring unique value with our competitive advantages and we can bring in something that's accretive to the value of our overall portfolio, then obviously we would be very interested in that type of an opportunity.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes I do. Just to go back to the Permian again and reinforce the point I have made my terms. We are taking a different approach to the Permian. I mean we are taking an approach which is leveraging the scale of this corporation. It's a manufacturing approach. We're doing it at scale, which obviously a lot of the small players wouldn't have the capacity to do that. And we're going to do it through the cycles. We have the capacity to do that. We believe we have a significant capital advantage by doing it that way. And as a result of that, I think if we can demonstrate and we will and we are demonstrating that, we can demonstrate it. It puts us in a position where we have an advantage development plan that we could apply that to other resources in the basin should we see fit to do so.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, hi good morning. I guess my question, my first question, so it's a bit of a follow-up to a couple of questions that have been asked maybe slightly differently. If we look at the quarter, there's a fair amount of debt added this quarter and you talked about kind of just investing through the cycle. You have the $15 billion of asset sales that you're targeting over the next three years and you want to keep the balance sheet ready if an M&amp;A opportunity comes along. But if we look at it that way and think about the way the script looks right now, does it make more sense to not think about share buybacks to just keep the balance sheet in the best shape you can with assets or proceeds as you invest through the cycle? Just want to kind of tie that altogether? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I'll start and then Neil maybe you can add anything you want to add. But I think the strength of this balance sheet is really important of course, but it's being demonstrated by the current market conditions because as I said in my other comments, we feel very strongly. We have the capacity to maintain our investment plans through these low points in the commodity cycle.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Actually, we -- at the current conditions if they were maintained and we see these as very low as you have seen and Neil pointed out from his chart, if they were to maintain those conditions, we still believe we have the capacity to execute our plans if these conditions would remain through 2025 and still have some powder to execute an acquisition should we want to do so. But of course, it's something you watch closely. You're constantly looking at that all of the time. But today and on a planning basis, we feel like we have the capacity to make no change at all to our plans. And even if these low margins continued, we can continue with our plans. Neil, do you have anything to add to that?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. I am just -- thinking back to the Investor Day Phil, when we talked about this, we conveyed that we felt very comfortable with the investment program that we have available to us. We talked about the priority of doing a reliable growing dividend and that we felt comfortable with the balance sheet and that we didn't feel at that time that we need to do any additional maintenance on the balance sheet. And so to the extent, we had proceeds coming from asset sales or additional cash coming from higher prices and margins given where we were in those priorities likely the cash would then come back through buybacks, but that was obviously given a current or an assumed price and margin environment and we are in a different environment today, but when these proceeds come in from these asset sales, which is a target out to 2021, we don't know what environment we will be in at that time.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So it's difficult to predict exactly where that cash would go, but we can reaffirm what the priorities are. We're going to continue to invest in accretive projects, pay a reliable growing dividend and ensure that we have the capacity and the financial strength to take advantage of opportunities that become available to us including when we have a downturn in margin to prices which is as we said a very attractive time to operate and invest when costs are lower and when others are pulling back. So, there's no change to the priorities. What happens when that additional cash comes in from those proceeds again, could occur over the next two or three years, it will be dependent I think on the price and margin environment at that time and what opportunities we see available to us.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Phil, I'd tell you, this is not something new for us. I mean, if you go back to the low crude oil prices in 2015-2016 that's when we lent into the business and made the acquisitions in the Permian, in Mozambique, in Papua New Guinea and in Brazil. And again, I go back to the strength of opportunities that we have right now is because at that low point in the cycle we have the capacity to move and pick-up some very attractive resources at very competitive prices.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I appreciate that and obviously you can't time the asset sales quarter-to-quarter so certainly can appreciate that. On the Chemical side, I guess my follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked is that if I look at the performance of ExxonMobil specifically over the past five quarters your earnings have gone down every quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And I know this quarter you had some maintenance so some of that will come back here. But if I look relative to other some of your other peers where you have traditionally kind of tracked their performance, I think they have seen a bit better performance recently and yours has continued to degrade and so just kind of shifting through the sides I know you called Paraxylene as one factor. Is that -- if you're to kind of disaggregate the performance would you say that that is the primary factor that you think is differentiating your softer performance recently? Or are there other things we should be thinking about? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Well, I think there are other things. I think what you have to start with in the Chemical business is looking at the configuration of the assets that each Chemical company has and our business is heavily weighted towards steam cracking and polyethylene by order of magnitude and it's sort of 65% of our Chemical business.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Polyethylene and ethylene margins for us have been very strong for multiple years and we've benefited from that. And at this stage of the cycle the ethylene polyethylene margins for the reasons that we already discussed are down. If you have a Chemical company that has 25% of its business in ethylene, polyethylene and the rest of the business in other products you probably wouldn't see that impact of ethylene and polyethylene. It's really driven by the configuration of assets that you had.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">If we look across our Chemical company's performance over the last 12 months in terms of operations, in terms of delivering on their higher-margin growth it's been at or above plan. The total impact we are seeing is because of industry margins being down due to overcapacity. That has been primarily driven by ethylene and polyethylene primarily driven by these big incremental capacity coming on the Gulf Coast.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Paraxylene is similar. Paraxylene is also a significant part of our Chemical company nowhere near the size of ethylene and polyethylene. There has been some big capacity increments of Paraxylene that has come online in China in the recent months and that's put Paraxylene margins under pressure. These are cyclical businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">The performance has no change. The underlying drivers of these businesses are unchanged. The underlying drivers for demand are unchanged. What's really important for us is that we continue to deliver more competitive steam crackers in polyethylene businesses than anybody else. That's why I made the comments when we were talking about the latest investment to Corpus Christi.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">This is significantly advantaged we believe versus any other Gulf Coast investment. It's a significantly lower capital cost. We're leveraging the scale of our Upstream organization. We located the plant so close to the Permian. It's a cost advantage and we are producing not commodity polyethylene, but higher value or higher margin polyethylene. And so we don't see any change to the structure of this business. This is a margin impact-driven by short-term excess in supply.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Phil Gresh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. Appreciate the comment. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Rigby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Good afternoon and also good morning. Thanks for taking questions. Two please. The first is, I hear what you say about M&amp;A opportunities and so on in the Permian and I guess, those will come around periodically and you'll take a look at those when and if they arise. But we've got the surplus transfer rights opportunity coming up in Brazil in November and you could argue that that is somewhat more singular. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Rigby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">So I just wonder whether you could talk a little more about what your attitude is to that? And maybe if I just add my second question straight away…. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Rigby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I was just looking at your CapEx profile in the U.S. in the Upstream and I see it bumping up both sequentially and year-over-year and I guess that may in part have something to do with your comments around infrastructure build out. So I just thought maybe it would be good opportunity if you could just sort of lay out the activity in a little bit more detail around infrastructure as well as the drilling activity. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jon. Let me start with the transfer of rights in Brazil. Búzios, which of course, is the big reservoir down there the big resource that's in those transfer of rights. I mean, that's the largest one there are other ones of course, but Búzios is by far the largest. Because it is so large I think everybody in the industry will have a look at that. I'd be very surprised if they didn't. But it is very, very large. It is singular. Those kind of sizes of what I'd call discovered resources it's relatively well-delineated.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">The way I look at it is we have to bring some advantage to that versus anybody else in the industry. And if I can find a way where we can bring a significant advantage therefore we can get more value for our shareholders and we don't just get into a bidding war versus other players because I mean that's not the business. We want to be able to bring an advantage to that resource should we want to participate.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">We are looking at that resource as I am very, very confident all the major players are in the world. It doesn't mean to say that we're going to act on it Jon, but we're certainly looking at it. It is a large resource and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. And obviously I don't think you'd expect me to say much more than that.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">And in terms of CapEx, actually I'm very proud of where we are. With 50% as a corporation of our CapEx plan in the middle of the year and actually if you peel the onion back further with 50% of our CapEx plan in the Upstream halfway through the year as well. So we're tracking in total on plan. It doesn't mean to say there aren't some puts and takes I mean there are.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">I think in terms of the above surface buildout, particularly in the Delaware basin what I laid out in March is we have to put a lot of upfront money to build out those facilities both compression and these development corridors and all of the logistics within the basin. That's part of our plan.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">I would tell you there are puts and takes in all of that. Overall, we are on plan. It's well documented that it is taking longer to drill these horizontal laterals in the Delaware right now than it is in the Midland. And you see the numbers -- you've all seen the numbers that are reported externally.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">Key -- for all the players in the Delaware that we find a way to get those drilling times down closer to what we see in the Midland. We are working that we're making decent progress, of course, I want us to go faster, but we are making decent progress. So there's nothing really to flag outside of what we have already said. It is within the range of what we had expected. And today, our Permian production is accretive to earnings. We are making money in the Permian right now.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Rigby</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Well, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yeah. Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Biraj Borkhataria</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one, a question on Pay, so, I understand the question for the pace of development in Guyana. And obviously you're taking advantage of the services available at very good prices.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">For the Permian, are you concerned at all that the pace of your development. And the impact it could have on the overall oil market. I get not all of the growth is oil, but a substantial amount of that exponential growth chart is oil.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">And then, if you take you guys plus Chevron and a handful of your peers, it looks like the majority of the sector wants to grow volumes faster than the market is growing, which suggests prices may be not that positive over the medium-term. So I just want to get, your thoughts on that. And whether you think it's a concern at all. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yeah. Thanks, Biraj. I mean again I'll make some comments. And Neil, if you have any feel free, to jump in. I mean, I think, we laid out that pace and we said we are going to get to one million oil-equivalent barrels in the Permian and Bakken by 2024, if I remember correctly.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">That's not driven by anything more than we see these. And it's extremely competitive. We see them as less outside of the supply curve. And we see them as high returns and within our capacity to execute them to the standards that we expect to execute them. That's the way we look at it.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">What really is important, in a commodity cycle, in commodity businesses, is to make sure that, we have a competitive advantage versus anyone else in terms of cost of supply. And it's really driven by cost of supply. That's why I am so keen, that we maintain our capital discipline in the Permian.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">We must continue to work the capital cost down and to deliver on what we have laid out in our plans. Remember, this is a declining business. You have to keep replacing your capacity. And what's key for us.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">And key to win in this business is to make sure that our portfolio is the most competitive in the industry. And that's the basis of these plans. And the Permian is a big part of that. Do you have anything to add on that?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">No. I guess the only thing I would add globally the market again remains balanced. Demand growth continues to be strong. Obviously, OPEC has remained committed to their cuts. You have oil that's off-line in Venezuela and Iran and other locations. So you are seeing growth in the Permian. But I think overall, we are still seeing a relatively balanced market.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">All right. Your next question goes to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Good morning, Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Good morning, Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">If we could come back to I think it was slide 9, the one showing the margins. And kind of where you are relative to the 10-year, I was just curious, so as we look particularly at the downstream and the Chemicals.<br/></p>, <p class=""p p16"">If you think about those margin performances call it a lost opportunity or adjusted for your downtime, kind of how much was truly margin loss versus had you run at a normal level of activity, where you think those margins might have been?</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Can you help us think about maybe where cash flow should be back half of this year, given maybe more normalized levels of downtime?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. Well. I'll make sure you I understand the question, Roger. What would be the impact, if we didn't have the reliability incidents, is that your question?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. What if we were to isolate only the margin aspect in terms of price or let's just say net margin the industry offered versus net margin you captured?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. I think two things to bear in mind. I think in terms of our performance, in the first half of the year. And the second quarter in refining, I highlighted in my comments, that there was $150 million earnings impact from those three significant reliability events. Isolate those and that gives you a number.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">There is a much larger impact from the heavier turnarounds, scheduled maintenance that we have. And Neil gave some numbers in terms of how that would manifest and how that will change in the third and fourth quarter. I don't know, Neil, if you have anything else to add?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. And Roger again, just so I understand what you're asking. The charts on slide 9, those are industry margins. Those are not the realization that we captured. Those are again somewhat reflective obviously of our footprint. But they are industry margins.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">I think the other thing to -- really, really important here is, the industry margins manifest themselves differently in each of the refinery players. It depends on your configuration.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Just to give an example, if you have no refining assets in Europe and the European margins are low of course that will hit the European players. And not hit the players who don't have a footprint in Europe.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And even if you just go into one region, like the United States, the refineries are different. Some are high conversion refineries, some are low conversion refineries. There are different margins, for high and low margin.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">In the U.S. there are different margins on the Gulf Coast versus the Midwest. And so, when you look at these margins, you have to peel back the onion further and apply the specific margins to the individual configuration, both geographic and technical configurations of your refining assets that differs from company to company.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">What has been shown on the chart that Neil showed, was I think was an average of industry or an industry market price of this.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Hansen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yeah. That's right. And Roger, maybe just from a downtime, maintenance, earnings impact in the first half of the year. I think for the Downstream in the second quarter we showed on Chart 11 it's in roughly $500 million $600 million. So I think the first quarter was a little bit lower than that.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And then for Chemicals, it was a little bit below $200 million. And then we tried to show, on slide 11, what that looks like in the third and fourth quarter. So again down significantly, I think from what we have seen in the second quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some indication where we will be in the second half of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Roger just to go back to my point on slide 9 that was Downstream margins, that reflects an equal weighting a-third, a-third, a-third of markets in the U.S. Europe and Asia. And so it's an average. It's an illustrative. But if you don't have a-third, a-third, a-third in those three regions then your margins could be different than that.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yeah. For sure, I appreciate the clarification. Because my original interpretation was that was your margins not just industry margins.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yeah.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Okay.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">And then just as a follow-up question on the Permian. I mean, I know we have the chart that shows the pace there, but phenomenal performance in Q2 and familiar with timing of well completions things like that. As you think about Permian growth at this particular juncture is what we saw in Q2, what you believe becomes more representative? Or Q2 is just kind of one of those quarters where you're zigging and zagging a little bit? Just zigs just above the line and maybe over the next couple of quarters we zag back towards the line.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">As Sam mentioned, we don't have a lot of clarity on a lot of what you're doing out there or at least not contemporaneously. So I was just curious to how you think about the performance in the Permian? And maybe where that shakes up?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Your vocabulary on zigging and zagging, I describe it as a lumpy. And the reason I say, it's lumpy is, because the way we are developing the Permian is that we can drill a lot of docks and we can frac a lot at different times. So I don't anticipate and if you go back to the chart when you see or read our actual performance, that's kind of what you're going to see.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">You're not going to see the same growth every single quarter. But we are very confident that we can meet that what's a green famously called the green blob. But the green growth profile, Roger I'd say that's what we are going to -- we will meet. You’re absolutely right, it will be a zigging and zagging, but it is not necessarily the way everyone would develop. It reflects our development plan that we're going to have particularly in the Delaware, these long corridors of well pads.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">And we're going to drill up multiple benches at one time. And if you think about it move those drilling rigs down the corridor bring in those frac crews, frac them and then you'll see a boost in production. So I don't think it will be the right thing to do to look at every single quarter and say that we'll repeat that growth rate every single quarter. But I am very confident that we're going to meet the overall growth rate that we represented in that famous green production growth zone.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Roger Read</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Next we'll go to Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Hey, guys. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Hi, Paul, thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">I have one Downstream, one Upstream. Neil for Permian, I think in March June you was mentioning that the rig count will probably go to about 55 exit rate this year and then next year may go to 60, 65 depends on the activity level. Is that still some of digging pain at this point or that has been changed based on the additional information you have seen over the last several months?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yeah. I would say the 55 number is a number that I would still think we will be at the year-end, and we haven't got any change in plan on that. I really don't -- I don't get fixated on the number of rigs quite frankly. I mean that was a sort of what we estimate we will have. If the productivity of these wells is better, we could reduce, I mean, that's all about this capital efficiency that I keep coming back to.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">So as a planning basis, I mean, today we are up what I say 51, I think across both basins right now. That's in line with getting to sort of that 55 number call at the year-end, but it could be 53, it could be 56, 55 is the best planning basis I can give you.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Sorry. I guess my question is that I mean based on what you see over the last several months in the productivity and everything or within that I feel basically that is still the same plan that you haven't really changed. There's no material information that you have seen either improvement nor deterioration comparing to your current plan?</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Yeah. I mean, there is nothing to flag, because it is within the range of our planning basis. I mentioned a few minutes ago, what's really important is to increase or improve the drilling time in the Delaware. I read about numbers and people are saying in the industry that it is taking 30% longer to drill the same length well same length lateral in the Delaware as it is in the Midland.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">Actually, I think it's a little bit different than that. There are some parts where that's too high and depending on the length of the lateral exchange, but it is indicative that it is taking longer, and that is a key activity for us to get that drilling time down, because this is obvious, if you can't get that drilling time down to the level that you expect to in your planning basis, you can do one of two things. You can cut back your volumes so you can add more rigs.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">We still believe in our planning basis, we will get the productivity that we have and that reflects the number of rigs, the capital outlay and the volumes that we're predicting. But it is the most important thing Paul, I would tell you.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">And the way we're going about it is we have moved the total ExxonMobil capability into this basin. We are applying all of our drilling capabilities from all around the world to this very, very important area. And I feel very, very confident in our plans, I feel very comfortable with where we are heading. I wish we could close that gap faster.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">And I think your -- from a rig count standpoint you're about 50-50 between Midland and Delaware. Should we assume that will be the case for the next one or two years?</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Yeah. Actually, I'm not sure we're 50-50 right now. We're still -- we have more rigs in the Delaware today than we do in the Midland, but that's part of our development plan in the order of magnitude, if I remember, I think we have maybe, I think it is 29 in the Delaware and 22 in the Midland right now just for the numbers.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">But our resource, our well inventory in the Delaware is much, much higher than it is in the Midland. And I think we've been quite clear and again I come back to -- this is such an early stage to jump to conclusions. And just to give you an indication, we estimate we have a well inventory in the Delaware of something around 6,500. So 6,500 well inventory, we drilled 100. We drilled 100. So it's very tough to extrapolate from 100 wells where you're going to be with 6,500.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">And that's why I think it's so, so important that we stick to our long-term planning basis. We know what we have got to do, but to try and extrapolate and draw too many conclusions from that number of wells, I think it just needs -- I think we need to be careful about doing that.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Right. Final question for me under the IMO 2020 world most of your ability in your refinery to take the high sulphur we see it as a feed directly to the coker with minimal system?</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Yeah. I think as you know if you could sort of peel back the onion at IMO with these new regulations the shipowners have this multiple option. They can buy low sulfur fuel oil, they can install scrubbers or if they can switch to some other piece like liquefied natural gas.</p>, <p class=""p p18""> The way that plan plays out is the demand for high sulfur recedes, we would anticipate it will decline and the demand for low sulfur will increase. And you would anticipate so that will -- that could lead to changing spreads of course. I think if you have low conversion refineries, you'll be incented to run -- to reduce sulfur by running sweet crudes. Our refineries particularly on the Gulf Coast are high conversion refineries with low fuel oil production.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">And so we would say that we feel very well positioned in the U.S. We have high conversion refineries. We added this big new coker in Antwerp and we're investing in projects that reduce high sulfur fuel oil production in Singapore. So we've been planning this for a long, long time. The market will do what the market will do, but directionally we feel like we sit in a very strong and advantage position.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Sure. I guess my question is that I mean, can you take the high sulfur fuel oil and directly feed it into your coker as a feedstock instead of buying heavy oil? So replace the heavy oil run your refinery by using the high sulfur fuel oil I guess that's my question.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">I think the answer to that is yes, if we have spare capacity. I mean, I think that's the bottom line on that. That's what they're there for. You can do that. But of course, we're balanced across that's why we invested in the coker to size it for our facilities across Europe. But the answer is, fundamentally yes, you could do that if you have capacity.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Okay. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Thank you, Paul. I think we have time for one more question.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">We'll take our last question from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Yeah, hey. Thanks for taking my question a the end of the call. Firstly, we didn't touch on a couple of projects. The Mozambique LNG development and what's going on in Papua New Guinea. You did put in your press release that you still expect to sanction Mozambique at the end of this year, but there's been some reporting that you're looking at maybe changing who's doing the EPC on that project and I'm wondering if that could delay when you would sanction it? And then just any updates on what's going on at Papua New Guinea with negotiations with the government would be helpful. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Sure, Jason. I think in Mozambique, we're still proceeding on the planning basis that we have for Area 4 and the two lines that we're going to put in Rovuma. There is likely to be at least we read there will be a change in ownership on Area 1, of course everyone reads that and Patrick made some comments and I think earlier on this week publicly that we have had some very, very preliminary discussions with Total to say, is there something more we can do to between Area 1 and Area4 to get the capital costs down.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">That's a very, very early stage, because of course that ownership has not changed yet. But I think as Patrick said, if there's something there in the interest of both companies, so for sure we will look at that to improve the capital efficiency. But no change right now in our current planning basis. I think Patrick's comments were more talking about if something comes down the road then it's advantageous to both companies or both consortiums more Area 1 Area 4 than obviously we would look at it. But our planning base is to go ahead with what we've already communicated.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">In terms of Papua New Guinea and the Papua LNG change of government there President, Marape is in power and I met with him about one month ago. And as he has publicly said and as petroleum minister has said they want to look at the legal aspects of Papua. Our understanding is they've had that review and they're discussing the outcome of that review now. As far as we're concerned, we have an agreement with the government. Prime Minister, Marape understands that.</p>, <p class=""p p19"">And I don't see any change, but we'll have to wait and see what comes out of the government discussions. I have to say, Total is the operator on this block, so you really have to talk more details with them. As far as we're concerned, we have a contract and we honor our contracts and we anticipate no change in that agreement.</p>, <p class=""p p19""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p19"">Thanks. If I could just ask a question another one about chem. I know it's been covered pretty in depth today, but a peer had mentioned that they're seeing destocking in the China Chemical landscape in terms of inventory and there's been discussions kind of about an emerging naphtha oversupply. And I was just wondering if you're seeing one China kind of tapering back its feedstock costs per purchases? And if that is reverberating through the supply chain particularly for naphtha? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">Just to make sure I understand Jason. You're talking about destocking of polyethylene?</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">No. So kind of not buying as much feedstock cost for their naphtha crackers and the inventory on hand.</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong><span class=""answer"">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">I think it's pretty typical in a commodity business. People raise their inventory levels and reduce their inventory levels. Sometimes people speculate in terms of where they think prices are going and margins are going that's typically why people do that. I don't know if in China there's a destocking and folks believe that there is going to be some change in naphtha price. Naphtha is driven by of course fundamentally by expectation on crude oil price, but also the differential between naphtha and crude is driven by the supply/demand of naphtha.</p>, <p class=""p p20"">So I really -- I hate to speculate on why they're destocking. I think what you have seen in the markets over the last 12 months is relatively low naphtha prices versus crude oil. And I think that's primarily driven by this it is more like crude is on the market which leads to more condensate, which leads to more naphtha. And so you're seeing a trend in that over recent months. But I think it would be to speculate on short-term destocking in China I don't think I can add anything to that. Neil?</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong>Neil Hansen</strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">Thank you. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight the second quarter that concluded. Again, excellent progress in the Permian and the achievement of a number of key milestones across our portfolio. I appreciate your continued interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p20""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p20"">That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.</p>]"

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2019. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Heather Miner</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. On this call, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Today on the call, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment, give an update on several recent strategy decisions and discuss our stress test results. Stephen will then cover second quarter results across each of our businesses. They will be happy to take your questions after that.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I'll now pass the call over to David. David?</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>David Solomon</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks Heather. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I am very happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">Net earnings were $2.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $5.81. All in, we posted return on equity of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our business performed well and remained solidly positioned for future growth. In Investment Banking, we ranked number one in global announced and completed M&amp;A and number one in global equity underwriting year-to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions. We produced the quarterly I&amp;L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment - investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&amp;L which annualizes the $3.5 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Lastly, our assets under supervision increased by over $60 billion to another record of $1.7 trillion.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Turning to Page 2, our second quarter results were generated on an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges. This quarter perhaps more than others reflected changing market sentiment in each of the three component months. Against this shifting sentiment, we continued to witness relatively solid underlying economic fundamentals. This year, we expect real GDP growth of approximately 2.5% in the US and 3.4% globally. European growth remains a bit more subdued at about 1.5%. As recently reported, China is running in the low 6% range, slower than it has been in many years, but still supportive of global growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">All in while slowing, the global macro backdrop remains broadly constructive. The strong fundamentals that prevailed across markets were nonetheless overshadowed for most of the second quarter by geopolitical uncertainty. Client activity in April turned quiet amid low volatility particularly in fixed income markets. Conditions in May deteriorated as geopolitical events caused significant shift in risk appetite. Fears of expanding trade wars drove concerns that new tariffs in China and Mexico would erode the prospects for continued growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In response, equity volatility then increased; global markets turned risk off, the US yield curve inverted, and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investment clients stayed on the sidelines. The trade issues also catalyzed concern among global central banks prompting dovishness with the Bank of Japan and the ECB emphasizing potential further stimulus and the US market is now anticipating multiple Fed rate cuts this year. The articulated dovish sentiment spurred a relief rally and increased client optimism and activity albeit late in the quarter. This set up June to be a stronger backdrop to close out the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The market sentiment in June has continued through today. We've seen a pause in the US-China trade war, accommodative views from central banks, and continued march upward in global equity markets. Credit financing markets remain open and strategic transactions are getting announced. As we look ahead, we remain cautious on the geopolitical front, but optimistic given the resiliency of global markets. Importantly, our clients' long-term needs for advice, financing, and access to markets endure across cycles.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives in wealth management businesses. First, on alternatives, which is our core strengths for Goldman Sachs for the past 30 years, we recently completed an internal reorganization of our investing activities across the firm. More specifically, we have realigned our special situations group, real estate, merchant banking, and several other investing platforms under common merchant banking business.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We have a world-class investing franchise with a strong track record, unique sourcing and execution capabilities, and long-standing relationships with the largest institutional investors. Going forward, these teams will operate across four asset classes; private equity, growth equity, private credit, and real estate. By bringing together our investment professionals, we will accelerate our ability to raise significant third party capital. We expect this change will enable us to generate more durable recurring fee based revenues over time. This will be a transition. We are mindful of protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third party assets.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Second, we announced plans to acquire United Capital, registered investment advisor with approximately $25 billion in assets under supervision, 220 advisers and 90 offices around the country. United Capital represents a key step forward toward our long-term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum. Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, which serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We are excited about the incremental scale that United Capital brings, allowing us to serve a broader set of wealth management clients. On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise. It remains ambitious -- it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra-high net-worth individuals through our longstanding PWM business. Individuals with $1 million to $5 million of investable assets through Ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Before turning the call over to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on the recent Federal Reserve stress test result released in late June, which showed bank’s ability to withstand over $400 billion stress losses. Overall, the industry fared well in this year's examination. From where I sit, the results of the stress test clearly demonstrate the overall safety and soundness of the US financial system. We also appreciate the ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the test and very much agree with the Fed's overall assessment that the US banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to support the economy even after a severe shock.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning specifically to our performance on the 2019 CCAR examination. As you are now therefore aware, we disclosed the Federal Reserve did not object to our plan of up to $8.8 billion of capital return including a 0.47% increase on our quarterly common stock dividend. This change reflects the board and management view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns, and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Lastly, I would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters. Importantly, we continue to work toward providing a strategic update this coming January and we'll share a specific date once confirmed. This update will include the financial targets for the firm to which we will hold ourselves accountable and a broader review of our business strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">With that I will turn it over to Stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Stephen Scherr</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thanks David. Let's run through the numbers. Let me begin on Page 3 of the presentation. As David mentioned, the environment in the second quarter turned out to be mixed. Against this backdrop, we continue to serve our clients and focus on executing on our strategic priorities.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let's run through the numbers in detail. Moving on to Page 4, Investment Banking produce net revenues of $1.9 billion, 3% versus the first quarter and down 9% versus a robust year ago quarter. Financial Advisory revenues of $776 million were down 3% versus last year. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $465 billion and closed on $235 billion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&amp;A league table rankings year-to-date. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Client dialogues remain healthy and we are seeing momentum across sectors including TMT, healthcare and notably financials, which had been rather dormant for a number of years. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $482 million improves significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year. Year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We held leadership roles and bringing many notable companies to the public markets during the quarter including Uber, Avantor, Pinterest and Slack.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to Debt Underwriting, net revenues were $605 million, down 20% from a year ago. The second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leveraged finance activity, which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter. Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings, particularly with financial sponsors. Nonetheless, our franchise remains well-positioned with our high-yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year-to-date further reflecting our competitive strengths.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our investment banking backlog decreased slightly versus the end of the first quarter as we monetized a portion of our pipeline through the completion of several large equity underwritings. Nonetheless, our backlog increased sequentially in both advisory and debt underwriting. And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialogue and continued need to access financing markets.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter down 3% versus last year, as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year reflecting both the mix operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Overall, the opportunity set presented in the second quarter proved more challenging versus a year ago. Specifically, we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment sentiment. Relative to last year, client activity and rates and currencies including emerging markets was more subdued as trade and tariff concerns more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement. Uncertainty during the quarter around the timing and magnitude of anticipated rate cuts by the Fed was also a contributing factor. As tariff threats lessened and the direction of rates became more apparent, we saw improved client activity, particularly late in the quarter. In currencies, both implied and realized volatility in major FX pairs stood at historic lows throughout the quarter, resulting in very low activity levels among our clients.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Commodities performance by contrast was a positive. Results increased year-over-year on solid contributions from our industrial products, oil, and gas and power businesses. In our micro businesses, we saw lower activity and credit but better results in mortgages. In credit, issuance activity and our inventory levels were down relative to a year ago, as investors remain more cautious following the spread widening experienced at the end of 2018 and grew more discerning in credit exposure selection. We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while closing credit came alongside a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leveraged loans as I had mentioned earlier.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Separately, mortgage revenues increase amidst better performance. The environment notwithstanding and as I have said previously, we are investing heavily to automate our workflows, serve our clients electronically, monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 6% versus a year ago. We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives and prime services in both hi touch and low touch channels. Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago. Results were aided by stronger performance in both cash and derivatives versus the second quarter of 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Net revenues from commissions and fees were $777 million, up 9% sequentially aided by strength in EMEA. We also continue to grow market share in low touch execution. Security services net revenues of $458 million rose 24% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Sequential improvement was driven by seasonal trends and a rebound in average client balances as sentiment improved.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Moving to Investing and Lending on Page 7. Collectively our activities in I&amp;L produced net revenues of $2.5 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated robust net revenues of $1.5 billion, driven by company specific events like IPOs and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing revaluations. Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities. As you can see on the slide, approximately 25% of our net revenues were from real estate and 75% were from our corporate investments. Within the corporate portfolio, nearly half of the performance came from investments that went public during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">These results included a gain of approximately $375 million from the IPO of Tradeweb. Our investment in Tradeweb which we've owned since 2008 was accounted for under the equity method given our significant influence at the time of the investment. As a consequence, we did not recognize revaluation P&amp;L on Tradeweb over the time of our investment. In addition to trade web, we would draw your attention to several other notable investments that IPO this quarter, including Avantor, Uber, and HeadHunter, which grew the notional size of our public holdings. Taken together, these four investments represent approximately 55% of our $2.6 billion public investment portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to Page 8, net revenues from Debt Securities and Loans were $989 million, included $872 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains. Our total loan portfolio was $98 billion, up $2 billion sequentially, driven by corporate loan growth and we note 82% of our total loan portfolio is secured. Our credit provision was $214 million, down 4%versus last quarter. Our firm wide net charged-off ratio remains low at approximately 60 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On Page 9 turning to Investment Management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading Private Wealth franchise. Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision. By contrast, we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsize $316 million last year. Incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We also saw lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.7 trillion, up $61 billion versus the first quarter, driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $12 billion of liquidity inflows and $32 billion of market appreciation.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now let me turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses of $6.1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense, offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments. For the year-to-date, total expenses were $12 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the topic of investment spend, as we've spoken in the past, cumulatively we are making very substantial organic investments to build new businesses and digital platforms. The depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 and 2020. Investment spending will continue into 2020 when we will also see more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the Apple Card following our expected launch later this summer.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Year-to-date, the total pretax cost from Markus, Apple Card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE. A cumulative pretax loss for these businesses from the inception of each through the second quarter was approximately $1.3 billion which has been embedded in the performance of the firm. As these businesses scale over the coming years, this drag should not only reverse, but become an accretive contributor to the firm's ROE.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Next on taxes. Our reported tax rate was 23% for the quarter and 20% for the year-to-date including discrete tax benefits in the first quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium-term estimate of approximately 22% to 23%. On the compensation ratio, our philosophy remains steadfast to our principles obtain for performance. Reduction in the year-to-date ratio to 36% is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the compensation accrual for the firm, which for the full year 2018 was just below 34%. Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">These platform businesses should carry higher and marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation as a cost contributor.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Turning to capital on Page 11. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.8% using the standardized approach and 13.5% under the advanced approach. The ratio is each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings. Our SLR was 6.4 % flat sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders including stock repurchases of $1.25 billion and $319 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 372 million shares. Our book value per share was $214, up 10% versus a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As David mentioned, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2019 capital plan of up to $8.8 billion of total capital return, including share repurchases of up to $7 billion, 40% higher than last CCAR cycle. While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position. We enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Following our successful completion of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, let's spend a moment reviewing our philosophy on capital. First our long-term view on capital allocation remains unchanged. We first look for opportunities to invest in our business at attractive returns to the extent we have access after these investments, we will endeavor to return it to shareholders. Second with respect to dividends versus buybacks, we aspire to having a higher dividend long term. As it's an important component of total shareholder return and it's further reflective of the firm's confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">That said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocations based on the environment and business opportunities. Third regarding the stress capital buffer, based on our calculations and the proposed rule which may differ materially in its final form, we estimate an SCB of approximately 5.5% based on the 2019 stress test results. This would imply a total CET1 requirement excluding management buffers in the neighborhood of 12.5% to 13%, which compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 standardized ratio of 13.8%. While we view the CCAR authorization as a ceiling and not a floor on the amount of capital we will return, we are pleased to note that the $8.8 billion capacity should position the firm well to manage capital at appropriate levels.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning to Page 12 for balance sheet and liquidity. Our balance sheet was $945 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter. On the liability side deposits increased to $166 billion including consumer deposits of over $50 billion, which we have more than doubled since last year. During the quarter, we saw further progress migrating businesses into our bank entities to take advantage of their more diversified and lower-cost funding. Our global core liquid assets averaged $225 billion during the quarter, which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business. As we go forward, we are executing diligently on three core objectives. One, serving our clients with excellence and growing our existing business. Two, diversifying our business into adjacent and new businesses and three, operating more efficiently in all that we do. If we do these things well, we are confident we can deliver strong, long-term returns for our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">With that, thank you again for dialing in. I will now open up the line for questions. </p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">[Operator Instructions]</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">GlennSchorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks very much. Maybe to start with a real quickie, you mentioned providing a strategic update this coming January. I'm curious what form you're thinking about meaning Investor Day, update slides on the call things like that?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So thanks, Glenn and good morning. I appreciate the question. We're committed to giving a strategic update and in particular providing targets in January. As we're working towards this fall when we know the exact format and also the specific date, we'll communicate it.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">GlennSchorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, well as long as the numbers are good I'm cool. In I&amp;L, I'm curious I know you're going through the process of consolidating the businesses and I'm sure there's some challenges there, but my question is on you've always been good at this but I feel like managing conflicts between advisor, balance sheet investment, and third party funds will just even be that much harder as you bring this all together and grow third party. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that. And how you will allocate investments across on balance sheet versus third party, things like that?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Sure, and I appreciate the question. It's obviously something we spend a lot of time thinking about. We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past had been organized over multiple parts of the firm. We're now internally reorganizing them and bringing them together but we've been doing this for 30 years. We are one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world. We manage a very, very significant amount of third party and client capital. And I can say that there are issues from time to time to come out of this business model, but we're focused on striking the right balance and have proven over the long period of time that I think we can do this consistently.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I think one of the things that you get by streamlining the organization and facing our clients as an integrated operation is it actually should make this process, the decision-making process easier and more clear. And so, we recognize it's something that we will have to continue to do well over a long period of time. We are -- I was talking to our clients and listening to our clients and they feel bringing the businesses together and organizing them, et cetera , will help us do that.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">ChrisBolu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Good morning David and Stephen. Just on the targets, we look forward to getting your targets in January but how should we think about the timeframe for achieving targets? Are you setting targets you can meet over the next one to two years? Or should we be looking for more long-term aspirational targets that could take more like five years to get to?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Christian. I would say that the targets that we will focus on will be both returns and equally efficiency and in the course of putting those out our timeframe will be over the medium to longer term. We're in the midst as I said in the prepared remarks of making some meaningful investments in the business. The depth of that is going to be over the course of this year and into 2020 and the returns on that will play out over the medium term. And so the targets will be that. Along the way, we'll continue to point out as we did on this call with greater clarity as to the precision of what it is we're spending and what we're spending for, and the direction of travel and the type of returns we expect to get.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But in that we're investing in particular businesses like the Apple Card, like Marcus, like transaction banking. Those will have return profiles. Equally, we're investing in platforms that will bring greater efficiency to existing businesses. Those two should have return profiles to them perhaps even inside some of the projects we have. But we will give you the medium-term targets, but take you along in terms of what plays out between now and then.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">ChrisBolu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great. Thank you very much. And then on the alternatives business, so we’re excited to see what this looks like when you bring it all together. I don't know if you could help us just preview maybe the size when you put all the strands together kind of what the size and maybe the growth profile of that business looks like today. And then as you look to maybe compete more against alternative asset managers, so that we were tricking one here, but how do you balance the sort of the delicate issue of doing what's right for Goldman versus competing against like a key clientele?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Sure. So first, with respect to the business broadly, we plan to operate across four broad asset classes that we operate in today currently. And that includes private equity. That includes growth equity, private credit, and also real estate. And so over time, we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels, which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third-party capital that we manage in these different asset classes.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">With respect to the balance and operating this, as I said to the previous question, we've been doing this for 30 years. These businesses are very significant in size right now. We have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively, they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today. And so we will continue to navigate and execute that the same way we have over the last 30 years in a very, very significant business. And the fact that we're internally reorganizing it, so that we can better serve our clients does not change the process that we've executed on for a very, very long period of time.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">The one other -- one other point I'll add to respond to your question is that David rightly points out this will be a transition. During that transition we do not anticipate a revenue shortfall by this movement. Meaning, we'll maintain balance sheet with the flexibility of reallocating balance sheet into different of these sleeves. As David pointed out and it's also worth noting that different sleeves whether it's credit, real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So we're very well aware of maintaining the revenue flow that's here and as David pointed out this will be a transition over time.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">MichaelCarrier</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on capital, so you receive the approval for more buybacks plus the dividend capital ratios have improved a lot. You're doing some on the M&amp;A front, still investing in the business. So I guess just looking for some color on if this is sustainable, meaning being able to do everything given the repositioning of the balance sheet. Probably importantly where you are on that front particularly within like the FICC business and the alternative business.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. So I think it's fair to say as a general matter this year CCAR clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return. And the scope of what we asked and what otherwise was approved reflects on our commitment to put capital back to shareholders. It's important to note those and as I said in the commentary, our posture has not changed. Meaning as stewards of capital we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long-term shareholder return.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">We're going to continue to do that and you see that in the investments that we're making. Away from that and in excess of it, will continue to return capital back to shareholders. And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are. On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC not borne of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and re-underwrite the business has been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering into our clients. And so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like. It's focused on the development of platforms, the investment in those platforms such as Marquee, on-pricing engine and investment grade credit equally the e-commodities business and equally having the talent to be good calibrators of risk intermediating which is at the core. When we do this and we do this right and it is a core historical competency for the firm. We're going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that and greater capital and cost efficiency.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">MichaelCarrier</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay, thanks and then just a follow-up question, just on this strategic review. I think there's a lot of focus on just sort of the revenue opportunities and where you guys are focused. Just given some of the investments and in the longer term to focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place, and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base and over time and improve the efficiency ratio.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. So I would -- I'll answer that in kind of two components. One is that the new business is being built whether that's the consumer business, credit card business is a part of it or transaction banking. Those businesses are intended to be built as scale businesses, meaning the compensation component attached to that is lower. You have cost and investment made such that the marginal margin in those businesses is operating at full scale continues to grow. And so you achieve greater efficiency on a higher revenue number that comes in. That's the way I would describe the newer initiatives.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">The second component is what we're doing in and around the introduction of platforms and technology to our standing incumbent businesses. I just mentioned a few examples of what we're doing in FICC and in the securities business more broadly. These two are lowering the throughput of trades, it's lowering the ability or I should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us, which is it's less human capital, it's more platform driven; it carries higher efficiency to it and that's the direction of travel.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I'd also say equally true about the incumbent businesses part of what we're doing in the Federation to support the businesses, including in places like compliance is the deployment of technology in order to render us more efficient such that we can support the businesses in a much more cost-efficient way than where we've been historically.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">The next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">StevenChubak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hey, good morning. So appreciate the color on the stress capital buffer, certainly the 5.5% reinforces the strength of your capital position. Given your current ratio are 70 to 120 basis points above that you're likely to create additional capital over the next four quarters. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about sizing the appropriate management buffer? And maybe just philosophically what are some of the factors that will impact that calculus?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, I think part of the calculus is the direction of travel right of where these regulations are. What the final SCB ruling looks like; equally there are inevitably variability that comes in fluctuation in CCAR results and the way in which stress is imposed. So we will maintain a buffer that's sort of mindful of those very abilities in the overall calculus itself. In terms of the general direction of capital sort of philosophically, it is -- it really is what I had laid out earlier and that is I think you should take the results in this CCAR in particular what we petitioned and what was left un-objected to by the Fed.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As the direction we'd like to go. We've got a lot on our plate in terms of investments that are being made, but we're quite confident under the circumstances of being able to put a reasonable amount of capital back. And I'd also point out that the dividend increase for this third quarter now approved by our board is a 47% jump in the dividend, which is also a reflection of the confidence in the increasing durability and profile of the revenues of the firm.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">StevenChubak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank for that Stephen. And just one more for me on efficiency. You size the $1.3 billion investment in some of the newer initiatives, given you noted that investment spend will likely peaked in 2019 maybe the early part of 2020, I was hoping you could speak to whether we should expect to see some efficiency progress as early as 2020. And what's a reasonable expectation in terms of the marginal margin? I know the newer initiatives are tougher to assess, but maybe on some of the legacy businesses given some of the changes you plan to implement on the platforms there.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. So, look, obviously the efficiency ratio is in one part of function of revenue. So we'll see where the fortunes of the front take us. On the expense base, I think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs, meaning what's happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to command, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past, just one really small example. If you look at our investment grade business and you look at the bond pricing engine, we can then play both sides of a risk trade in a way that would have taken thousands of man-hours right in order to compute.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">You would have had inefficiency in terms of its time value. Now we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost sufficient basis than what has happened in the past. So I think there's sooner efficiency or I should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses. There'll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency and some of the newer initiatives that we're building.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question is from the line of wives of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">BetsyGraseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, good morning. A question on how you're thinking about consumer or credit? And I asked the question for two parts. One is the upcoming Applecart and then the markets portfolio. And on the Applecart, I know you can't go through details, we put some estimates together in a note recently where again based on a lot of assumptions, I end up with an expectation that you're running it about that you would expect to run somewhere around a 1% ROA. Now that's again a lot of assumptions but it's based on the information that's out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers, what peers are charging and no fee. And I --the nut of my question is how are you thinking about consumer lending?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Is it a business that you think is inherently more risky than your current business which is running at about a 1% ROA? Or do you -- do I have it wrong? What am I missing? And should this be a business that generates higher than a 1% ROA, that's basically another question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure, thank you. So let me start by saying there's no denying that the consumer business whether card or Marcus is a risk business, meaning no matter that it's delivered digitally or that the credit card will take a different digital sort of profile than traditional credit cards, this is a risk business and that's where our focus is. I would say the risk is not just on credit risk and financial risk, but equally operational risk in the context of what we're building. And so we're quite conscious on all of those elements. What's important for us is that we look at this on a risk-adjusted return basis not simply on a return on asset construct.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And that's what's critical and that's the way we're looking at it. It would be Betsy for me premature to sort of speculate what the pace of growth looks like on this. I would simply say that risk calibration risk decisions in and around the part belong entirely to Goldman Sachs as the bank. And we're set up to make those. I'd also say that if you look at the level and rate of growth in the Markus loan business, while it continues to grow and perform well, we have slowed the increasing growth in that in contemplation of taking on increasing consumer credit through the card business. So we look at it both in its totality, so each is marginally different in a way in which credit is dispersed. But this is a risk business and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">BetsyGraseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">So on really that follow-up has to do with the expected at scale efficiency be that you think you're going to be running these businesses at when they're at scale, given the fact that you did a new build, should I be thinking about the efficiency and of these businesses in line with FinTechs which run at intermediate expense ratio that's 30% of other legacy competitors? Or should I look to bank competitors as a more reasonable expense ratio or somewhere in between?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I would say that while we've been in beta now for a couple of months and have grown the portfolio on that basis, it's nowhere near yet the scale of what our expectations would be as we grow it out. And so it would be premature for me to kind of speculate as to the efficiency. We'll start to reflect more on that once we launch and once we start to build this portfolio out. So it's a little early. What I can tell you is that what we have built jointly with Apple both on the front end and on the back end is intended to be operationally resilient, but equally is intended to be efficient both in terms of the delivery the app, I should say the application all through the delivery and on the backend and so my expectation is that the efficiency will be reflected in that, but again premature to sort of put numbers around it.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">MichaelMayo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi, to continue on the investment spend, as it relates to expansion of markets outside the US, where do you stand with the additional countries and what else might you consider?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">So I think on that Mike, the press has been sort of ahead of our plans in the context of speculating sort of the next country in which Marcus would expand. Obviously, our first place outside the United States was in the UK where the deposit platform has really exceeded our expectations in terms of what it's been capable of generating. There will be opportunities for us to expand in that market. There's been quite a bit of speculation about Germany. It's not surprising that the speculation goes there both in the context of a growing business that we have in continental Europe and the depth of the deposit market in Germany.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But it's too early to forecast as and if and when we would expand there though I understand the speculation on that. So for the moment we've got a lot on our plate in terms of the execution around the platform in the United States and in the UK and we'll continue to pursue that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">MichaelMayo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">All right and then one follow-up unrelated question. 1MBD did you take any additional reserves for that? What's the status? There's a new statement by the head of the SEC on July 3rd saying that it might be a little bit easier to resolve these sorts of matters? What's your take on all this?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">So just on the reserves, we took incremental legal reserves this quarter of $66 million. We don't give detail on what the elements of that reserve are. I would say that we are adjusting our RPL to $2.5 billion from $2 billion where it was. I should point out that in providing that number to you it's important to recognize that number is our best estimate as of this date. It will be published in the Q events that may play out between now and the Q could alter that RPL. And again there are different accounting regimes and thresholds that apply; one probable, one possible, possible relating to the RPL.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And so that's what I can offer you by way of what's happened financially. In terms of statements otherwise being made, I think it would be inappropriate for me to sort of speculate on what others intend by statements they make. I think as we've said in the past, we're in a cooperative engagement with the authorities. We intend to stay that way and as and when there are further developments, we'll be in a position to talk about that a bit more.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next questions from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">KianAbouhossein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi. I have two questions. The first one is related to your equity revenues which were clearly very strong. Also gain some PS reporting so far. And I just want to understand where that's coming from? Because clearly the drivers are more muted such as volatility is down on the equity derivative world. Transactions a volume are okayish, but nothing in terms of the numbers that you have shown in terms of year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter rates. Can you just give a bit more color of where the drivers are? And do you see market share movements in this area?</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And secondly just coming back to your FICC business. We've now heard from you over the last 12 to 18 months in expansion and more liquid products and traditional client base. And can you bit more detail on the FX and rates expansion both on clients and products? And when should we see actually some of those investments having an impact on your revenue base? Because I don't see you yet outperforming appears in this area, but clearly would be great to get an understanding if you are -- if you feel differently and why and what investments you're doing in order to close the gaps in those two sec?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So I'll start with equities. I make a broad comment on FICC and Steven will give you a little bit more detail. I--we were very pleased with the performance of equity franchise broadly. The performance really was across the franchise. It was throughout derivatives in cash, I would say given the market dynamics broadly, there's some sense of consolidating share and I think we've been benefit of that and as we've been stating on this call and over the handful of the last quarters, we continue to make the investments in our low touch activity or our low touch capabilities, and we're starting to see some benefits from those investments in our low touch capabilities.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">With respect to FICC, broadly I do want to highlight as was highlighted I think on page 5 of the presentation, our business is 90% market intermediation, a much higher component of market intermediation than the people that we compete or we benchmark against. So if you have a 60/40 mix and market intermediation is softer, which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter, your NIM portion or your non market intermediation portion has less volatility, but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and particularly in broadening out the client base, I'd ask Stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that's point through.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks David. So just a pivot to FICC and to be direct to your question. If you look at FX and rates and part of the progress that we were making is on broadening out the client franchise to more corporates than to the institutional clients to which we typically, if not exclusively have engaged. And we're starting to see some early progress in that. I would say in this quarter in particular within Europe. I'd also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around FX and rates, we're seeing some benefit come to us by way of the joint venture between banking and FICC, where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise, where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships, I think will bear dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">What's more I would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds including transaction banking or corporate cash management, this once built and will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive FX business that didn't exist inside the firm. I think that too could prove to be a benefit and just on that particular project Goldman Sachs is already a customer, if you will, of our own platform and we aim to bring customers and clients on in across 2020. And so we're seeing early signs of progress on this, but there's no running from the observation you make which is we have yet to sort of perform at the potential we're confident this business can show.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We're very confident in unlocking that potential. Some of these new initiatives will no doubt take a little bit of time before they bear out, but the direction we're moving is a positive one.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">BrennanHawken</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. NII as a portion of the I&amp;L debt portfolio, could you maybe help us think about rate sensitivity there? Depending on how you calculate NIM, if it's a 360 or 365 day count NIMs down either a few or upper single digits bps quarter-over-quarter. What are the benchmark rates, gents, predominantly in that portfolio we should watch? How much of the strong NII growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate? And then how should we think about how the softening rate environment might impact NII growth going forward? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that question is to just point out where we differ, if you will, from some of the bigger commercial banks. In the context of both, we have a different liability mix and equally a different composition to our assets. On the liability side, there's a portion of our funding that's fixed to portion that's floating. And so it's not as dynamically correlated, if you will, to the way in which rates otherwise move. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">And I think our NII growth generally speaking will benefit from a liability mix that's starting to skew towards deposits. And so that's the perspective I would offer on the liability side. On the asset side, much of the assets that we have are floating rate based and equally and importantly is a higher velocity term to the assets that underlie this. And that too has a more or leads to a more muted impact to what otherwise might see in some of the bigger commercial banks as a function of the direction in which rates are moving.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">BrennanHawken</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay and then the part on how much we've seen as far as rate or NIM improvement versus balances last year's? Is it possible to break that down or is that some might have to follow up?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I think I would encourage you to follow up sort of with for an answer that's more precise than one I can give you now. I would say that some of this has to do with balances in terms of the size and scope recognizing that the lending that we're doing which is generating this net interest income is quite strategic in the context of the clients that are served by the lending itself. And I'd also point out as I did in the remarks that about 82% of this is secured financing. And so I offer that to you but Heather and the team can provide you with greater insight onto the particulars.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next questions from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">JimMitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow up on the fixed-income discussion. Just want to make sure I understand how you get your assumed internal ROE targets in that business. Is it you see it entirely coming from efficiency improvements and expanding the footprint into more flow business or is there some component of capital that comes out whether it's derivatives or something else? Do you need to see the level of capital decline as well or can it come from those other ways?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure. So the way we've been looking at it as we've been scrutinizing and re underwriting that business is we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the ROE calculation, meaning it's important that nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in, i.e. how do we want to define the tangible market that we face. What's the revenue capture that we can take in? What's the expense as an offset to that revenue to establish the numerator in the calculus? And none of that is to ignore capital efficiency in the context of what the denominator contains.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So this is really as we've talked about it a wholesale re-underwriting of the business, but be assured both of these are in scope in the context of the way in which we're looking at the business. Both revenue net of expense and looking at capital and the revenue being driven largely by an ambition to have a more expansive addressable market to include corporates in addition to that which we otherwise have focused on historically.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">JimMitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And as you pull that capital out it, did you worry at all there's any kind of revenue risk in that pivot to a lower capital or denominator or do you feel that's not really the case?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">No. I mean, listen, this never is kind of a linear calculus, okay. So the business is for us in FICC are not themselves four-walled, meaning anything we do with respect to a business and FICC has knock-on implications for businesses that sit outside the securities business. Take for example whatever it is we decide to do around credit or commodities, it has knock-on implications. So the thread on the adjacency of all of our businesses gets pulled. So we're mindful of that and need to take stock of what we do around capital. The one other thing I would point out, which I've talked about publicly before is in addition to thinking about both the numerator and the denominator.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">Embedded in the numerator is equally an effort to sort of optimize our own funding, meaning how do we bring our cost of funds down, retail deposits has been an example of that, but our treasury team is working hard both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with? How that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient, lower-cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">DevinRyan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Great. Good morning, David and Stephen. First question just on the United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity. I guess broadly and as it connects with Ayco is there a bigger appetite to expand into the mass affluent segments whether it be adding financial advisors or more M&amp;A? Or does United Capital really give you just a big enough footprint to achieve what you're looking to do in the business especially with Ayco?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Sure. I appreciate the question. We're excited actually, today, I believe we're closing the United Capital acquisition on this very day. And obviously it brings with us our 220 RIAs and 90 offices around the United States. And what it's really doing is we think we have a very, very interesting channel to continue to build the mass affluent segments through Ayco. But this particular transaction accelerates our ability to do that between Ayco and United Capital of $80 billion of assets under management that's a good base from which you grow from.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">We think we can continue to make progress in what we'll call the $1 million to $5 million of investable assets mass affluent wealth management category through this channel. And that we can have good growth with the extended platform we now have. But if another opportunity came up that we sought to further accelerate it because this is still a very fragmented business, and we have a very, very big infrastructure, so we can continue. The fee in terms of all the wealth, in terms of all the asset management and wealth management products, we have in our asset management business, we'll consider it.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">This was not something, this acquisition was not something that was targeted for a year that we were really running after it, it came up for sale, we looked at it, we thought it was a really good fit to accelerate our business. And so we decided to act on it.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">DevinRyan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then just a follow up just to think about the third party alternative capital fundraising. Any expectations on whether it could be trajectory or cadence of how we should be thinking about that just as we're sort of think about modeling it?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yes. I appreciate the question, Devin. I know that you're all anxious to model it. Over time, we will provide a lot more transparency on how we see that plan went out. As you would expect, we have a lot of businesses across the firm we put them together. And the first thing you do when you put those people together is you task them to develop plans on a go-forward basis. And we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">GerardCassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you. Good morning. In your comments on the debt underwriting you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry, which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market and M&amp;A activity area. And you specifically cited it was with the financial sponsors. Can you share with us what are the financial sponsors seeing today? What do you think will stop them from doing more deal activity in the quarter? And any outlook for the second half of the year from those financial sponsors?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Well, look, at a high-end there's now -- at a high level, there is no question that activity has been more muted. I guess when you think about the cycle and you think about the continued run at equity markets and the accommodative monetary policy we have which is certainly inflated for assets, it's steady, it's been tougher more competitive, you have to pay more in order to succeed. I also think the financing environment in particular the SNIP regulatory overlay, it has some impact over this cycle and muting how far the private equity activity they have moved in this cycle has a regulatory environment been difference.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">That said the private equity investors still have an enormous arsenal of unspent capital big reserve. And I think this business continues that secular growth and so as the environment evolves, I think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we've seen in the first half of the year. I don't think we have a great explanation of this specifically has done it. I mean if you think about what the first and a half of the year has brought in terms of the macro overlay, it's not surprising probably that it's not a little bit more muted.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">GerardCassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Very good and then as a follow-up on slide 12 you give us your balance sheet of course the allocation. And you mentioned that in the quarter there was a $20 billion quarter-to-quarter increase reflecting client demand to use your balance sheet. Can you share with us the total loans or total assets what percentage of it is clients using your balance sheet? And then second and when you look at the revenues those customers bring to you as a percentage of those assets where those stand and how is that compared to about a year ago?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">DavidSolomon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">So as always the fluctuation in the balance sheet is a reflection of our ability to respond to opportunities and the interest of our clients. And so balance sheets fluctuation is all a function of client service. It's hard to decompose the balance sheet to say what's client -what not, what is not client. Truth, we know all of it, right, is in some manner or form related to client activity and across all of our businesses in the firm. And so that's really the way I would view to the balance sheet both in terms of growth size and its composition.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. </p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">BrianKleinhanzl</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yes, thanks. Just one quick question. On the market we saw that the rate pay came down towards the end of the quarter, kind of can you just walk through what your -- how you came up with that decision to lower the rate size just looking at the Fed Funds futures. Should we expect more rate cuts there and kind of what's been depositor behavior -- </p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Stephen Scherr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Sure. So we made a decision and it was the first since we began our retail deposit business. We made an adjustment downward. We did it in the context of rendering ourselves competitive in light of what others had done. It's also worth noting at or around the time we reduced the rate we saw others in the competitive set reduce the rate as well. We saw no material adverse reaction to our movement, no to the pronounced outflows nothing to really call attention to.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">I think you should assume that we will be fluid and flexible and agile in rate movement up or down relative to where the competitive set is. And will sort of comport ourselves that way both in our US platform and in the UK.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">End of Q&amp;A</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Stephen Scherr</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you in October.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Craig Menear</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Sales for the second quarter were $30.8 billion, up 1.2% from last year. Comp sales were up 3% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 3.1%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.17 in the second quarter. We're pleased with these results. We overcame a tough May and continued lumber price deflation to deliver accelerating comp performance throughout the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Looking at our results geographically, all of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps. 17 of 19 U.S. regions also posted positive comps with the exceptions being our Gulf and Florida regions which delivered high storm-related comps last year. Internationally, Mexico posted high single digit positive comp and Canada posted low single digit positive comp, both in local currency.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We saw broad-based growth across the stores, both comp ticket and transactions grew. With the exception of lumber, all of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. We saw a healthy balance of growth among both Pro and DIY categories with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As Ted will detail, we continue to invest in the portfolio of service offerings to deepen our level of engagement with the growth. We know that the more dimensional our relationship is with these customers, the more they spend.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">From a strategic perspective, I’m encouraged by the progress we are making to deliver the One Home Depot experience, a seamless, interconnected shopping experience for our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our in-store investments are focused on ease of navigation and improved speed to checkout. We have implemented our way-finding sign and store refresh package in over 1,400 of our U.S. stores. And customer service scores in the category of neat and clean, have increased 140 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our frontend store investments now at over 400 stores are designed to get customers in and out of stores faster, and they are doing just that. Customer service scores in checkout time satisfaction have increased over 450 basis points versus last year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">While our stores remain the hub of our business, we know that many of our in-store sales are influenced by online visits and approximately 50% of all online U.S. orders were picked up in our stores during the quarter. Our customers continue to blend the channels of engagement, and we are investing to remove the friction as they do so.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We continue to roll out automated pickup lockers for online orders with over 1,100 stores completed and have seen a 250 basis-point increase in checkout scores for stores with lockers versus those without. Our investment in the digital price labels for our appliance department has enabled us to incorporate ratings and reviews from the digital world into the store shopping experience, enhancing the overall customer experience in the category.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As we invest to address the unique demands of an interconnected customer experience in stores, we also continue to invest in our website and local applications to further enhance the digital customer experience. Our focus on improving search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation and product content has yielded higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Second quarter online sales grew 20% from the second quarter of 2018. We also continue to leverage our digital platforms to drive incremental growth from new categories as we lean into adjacencies like HD Home pool and workwear.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The traction we're seeing from investments across our digital and physical assets are encouraging, not only from a customer experience standpoint, but they are also driving productivity growth of the business. Our frontend investments are optimizing labor and merchandising space productivity. Digital appliance labels enable associates to be more productive with their time. Instead of spending multiple hours manually changing price signs, our associates can reallocate their time to engage with customers in a high touch category.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The virtuous cycle of productivity at The Home Depot has been a hallmark of our operational excellence over the years, and continues as we move forward.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our focus on enhancing the customer experience and productivity extends to the supply chain investments as well. During the quarter, we completed the retrofit of our Hagerstown facility into a partial direct fulfillment center, which expands our one-day delivery capabilities or stock parcel goods from approximately 30% to approximately 50% of the U.S. population.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also drove productivity and cost out through our patronization [ph] efforts in our upstream supply chain. We are on track with our plans to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement and are pleased with the progress that we have made thus far.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. The building blocks of our financial model remain in place. As Carol will detail, we are lowering our sales guidance through the year, mostly to reflect the impact of lumber price deflation, as well as some conservatism to account for the recently announced tariffs. We now expect fiscal 2019 comp sales growth of approximately 4% and reaffirm our expectation for diluted earnings per share of $10.03.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work, which resulted in the highest quarterly sales in our Company history. And with that, let me turn the call over Ted.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Ted Decker</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">While we had a slow start to the second quarter, we were pleased to see demand accelerate throughout the quarter as we helped our customers tackle a variety of interior and exterior projects. Looking at our departments, comps in appliances tools, décor and storage, indoor garden, building materials, paint, outdoor garden, hardware and plumbing were above the Company average. All other departments with the exception of lumber were positive but below the Company average. Lumber reported a high-single-digit negative comp due to commodity price inflation.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Second quarter comp average ticket increased 2% and comp transactions increased 1%. Lumber prices remained depressed during the second quarter, and as a result, lumber negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 110 basis points. Last quarter, we talked about a 4x8 sheet of OSB selling for about $8, more than 50% below the price a year ago. During the second quarter, the price for that same sheet of OSB fell further to an average of about $7 60.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">During the second quarter, big ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of U.S. sales, were up 3.7%, reflecting in part the impact of hurricane-related sales last year and lumber price deflation. Excluding hurricane-related markets only, big ticket transaction comps were nearly 5%. During the quarter, we saw strong performance in big ticket categories, like vinyl plank flooring, and patio.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Last quarter, we talked to you about opportunities in our flooring businesses. While vinyl plank has been and continues to be one of the strongest performing product categories across the store, we identified a need to refine our assortment within our other flooring categories. For example, in special order carpet, we’ve recently taken several actions. We upgraded all of our showrooms and reset the category to reflect the latest styles and trends, while offering the simpler shopping experience, showcasing a good, better, best line structure. Given the associate engagement that’s extremely important for this category, we also enhanced our in-store training efforts to drive the better customer shopping experience. While early days, we’re pleased with the results.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">During the second quarter, we saw growth in both our Pro and DIY customers with Pro sales outpacing DIY sales in the U.S. We continue to focus on our suite of Pro initiatives, because we know that the more we engage with them, the more they spend with us. We’ve equipped our store associates with a number of tools and better understanding of their top Pro customers. Our My View system allows our Pro sales associates to access customer data information, so they can proactively work with our Pro customers and determine how we can better serve them. We continue to simplify the Pro shopping experience and expand engagement through services like tool rental, delivery and our new B2B online experience.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">While May was another wet month, we saw project demand in outdoor categories rebound as weather improved. Categories like concrete, exterior paint stains, live goods and mulch at comps above the Company average. In addition, we continue to see customers respond to our industry-leading brands and the innovation they are bringing to market. In our outdoor power equipment business, we’re seeing strong customer demand and continued trade up to cordless tools like blowers, trimmers, and even lawnmowers. Exclusive cordless product for brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee, Dewalt, EGO provide our customers with superior functionality and runtime to keep their yards looking great.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Switching gears, as you heard from Craig, we are happy with the progress we are making with our investments to deliver best-in-class interconnected shopping experience. Looking at our likelihood to shop again metric, 87% of our customers give us the best-in-class score of 5. Our strategic investments include accelerated merchandise and resets focused on upgrading showrooms, improving visual merchandising and refining assortments to drive a better in-store shopping experience.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">For example, we are rolling out a new color solution center in our paint department, which simplifies the color selection process for our customers, while emphasizing our price, color, and satisfaction guarantee. And our new Project Color app, an updated online experience, allows our customers to seamlessly explore, be inspired, and shop color online whenever or wherever they want. Another example is in pipe and fittings, we are resetting all of our bays, reconfiguring them to better showcase the assortment and freeing up space at new product categories for our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now, let’s turn our attentions to back half of the year. As the number one retailer of ladders, we’re pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership with Werner, the number one brand for Pros. Multi-position ladders are the fastest growing segment of ladder category, and we are now the exclusive big box retailer of Werner multi-position ladders. We are also happy to announce an exciting new partnership with Louisville Ladder and their exclusive big box retailer, starting in the fourth quarter. Combining Warner with our exclusive Louisville Ladder and Gorilla brands, we’re the leading destination for top Pro brands in the ladder category.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our merchants have worked hard to put together events and special buys for our customers in the third quarter. We are excited about our customers’ continued appetite for home improvement projects, and in just weeks, we will host our Annual Labor Day event, followed by our Halloween harvest event.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Carol.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Carol Tomé</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As you’ll recall,, fiscal 2018 had a 53rd week, which shifted our fiscal 2019 calendar. Our comp sales are reported on a like-for-like basis, but total sales growth is reported on a fiscal year basis. In the second quarter, total sales were $30.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from last year, reflecting a shift in our fiscal calendar as well as the impact of deferred sales.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our total Company comps were positive 3% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.2% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.6% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 0.6% in May, 4.1% in June and 4.7% in July. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar and negatively impacted comp sales growth were approximately $29 million or 0.1%.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As you just heard from Ted, during the second quarter, lumber prices remained depressed. Versus last year, this lumber price deflation negatively impacted our comp sales growth by approximately $340 million or over 100 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of 19 basis points from last year. The year-over-year change in our gross margin reflects the following factors: First, higher strength than last year resulted in approximately 9 basis points of gross margin contraction; second, changes in the mix of products sold drove approximately 8 basis points of gross margin contraction; and finally, we had 2 basis points of gross margin contraction in our supply chain, driven primarily by startup cost associated with our One Home Depot supply chain initiative.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales at 18% was essentially flat compared to last year. Our operating expense performance reflects the impact of our strategic investment plan and good expense control during the quarter. Specifically, expenses related to our strategic investment plan of $242 million increased by approximately $28 million from last year and resulted in approximately 8 basis points of operating expense deleverage. This deleverage was offset by productivity in BAU or business-as-usual expenses, which drove 7 basis points of operating expense leverage. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.9%, a decrease of 21 basis points from last year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Interest and other expense for the second quarter grew by $37 million to $283 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than one year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.6% compared to 24.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For the year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $3.17, an increase of 3.9% from last year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">So, moving on to some additional highlights. During the quarter, we opened two new stores, one in the U.S. and one in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,291. Selling square footage at the end of the year was 238 million square feet. Total sales per square foot for the second quarter were $510, up 1.1% from last year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">At the end of the quarter, inventory turns were 5.1 times, down from 5.4 times last year, reflecting in part a load-in of inventory in support of our strategic initiatives. For the year, we now expect our inventory turns to slow slightly from what we reported in fiscal 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Moving on to capital allocation. In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 6.2 million shares of outstanding stock. We plan to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding shares in the second half of the year, bringing fiscal 2019 share repurchases to $5 billion, in line with our guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Further, during the quarter, we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $1.4 billion of long-term debt, of which $1 billion was used to repay senior notes that came due in June.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.7%, 580 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While global economic pessimism has increased due to geopolitics, currently, the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Consumer confidence is near record high levels and wages are up over 3% from last year. Housing metrics are in line with the assumptions we used to build our 2019 financial plan. Nonetheless, what we didn't expect when we built our plan was the significant lumber price deflation we’ve experienced. We are now more than halfway through the year and lumber prices are below the levels we saw in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Additionally, the U.S. consumer is facing the impact of tariff. While trade discussions are fluid, consumer demand could be impacted. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2019 sales and earnings per share growth guidance to reflect these changes.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Remember that we guide off GAAP. So, fiscal 2019 guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2018, which includes sales and earnings associated with the 53-week. For fiscal 2019, we now expect comp sales as calculated on a 52-week basis to increase by approximately 4%. That's down 100 basis points from the 5% growth rate we planned at the beginning of the year, reflecting for the most part, lower lumber prices, as well as some potential impact to the U.S. consumer from recently announced tariff. With this, we now expect sales to increase by approximately 2.3%, reflecting the compare to 53 weeks last year. We are also reaffirming our earnings per share growth guidance for fiscal 2019. For earnings per share, we expect fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 3.1% to $10.03. We are able to hold our earnings per share guidance to what we initially planned as lumber is a lower margin category, and because we are projecting a lower tax rate than our original plan.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Isabel Janci</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Christine, before we open the call up for questions, I’d like to turn the call back over to Craig.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Craig Menear</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you, Isabel.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As I mentioned on our last earnings call, Carol Tomé will be retiring as our CFO at the end of this month, after 24 years with the Company. She has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 18 years. And in fact, today’s call is the 73rd consecutive quarter she has reported our financial results to the market. I’d like to thank Carol for her deep commitment to our associates, the investment community and our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Carol has set the standard for excellence and transparency during these calls, reflecting not only her in-depth knowledge of our business, our operating environment, the economic environment, but also her dedication to our values. So, Carol, let me say thank you for your leadership and for your partnership, and your 24-year career at Home Depot. You’ll definitely be missed.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Christine?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Carol Tomé</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you, Craig. And we’ll try to get to your questions without me crying? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. </p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. That’s a hard lead in to ask a question off of.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Sorry about that one.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">All good. Carol, congratulations and best of luck. And you too Richard, good luck in following in those very large footsteps.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">They certainly are.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">So, my first question is, we have assumed that about three quarters of the reduction in your full-year comp guidance is due to the lumber price changes and the remainder, so about a quarter of a comp point is due to the macro. There’s obviously been a lot of concern on the macro recently, given the yield curve, inverting a large education institution that’s calling for a significant slowdown in remodeling activity and then, as you pointed out, the tariff uncertainty. So, do you think a quarter point reduction in your comp guidance sufficiently considers all of those uncertainties?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">So, Michael, let me make a couple of comments, and I’ll turn it over to Carol. So, first of all, when you look at the overall macro factors that we think are critical to how we line up our business, those have largely remained unchanged. And so, we feel good about the fact that the consumer has wages up about 3% year-over-year, consumer confidence is still high. So, the general trend that we see in the macro base and how we did our plans really hasn’t changed much. And we feel pretty good about that.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And then, when you think about going forward in the business, when we looked at commodity, hurricane and May and then compared that to where we were at the end of the quarter, we feel good about the guidance that we have.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">I’ll give you little bit more color there, Michael. So, the implied back half comp in the guidance that we just gave you is around 5%. If you look at our reported comp in the second quarter in the U.S., it was a 3.1% comp. If you add back the impact of hurricane-related sales, that’s 50 basis points of hurt. If you add back the weather-driven demand, softness that we saw in May, that was 40 basis points of hurt. And then, you heard us talk about commodity being 100 basis points. So, when you add that back, actually the normalized comp in the second quarter was 5%. Then, you heard us talk about the comp cadence and we exited July quite strong on an adjusted basis, the comp in the U.S was 4.7%. And then, I look at our -- how we are performing relative to plan, and we are on our plan. So, you add up all the data points and it suggests that comp guidance is very achievable. And the other way to look at it is just stack the comps. You stack the comps for the first half of this year against last year, stack the second half what we reported and what we are guiding to, the stack is about the same in most of the half. So, every way we look at it, we feel very good about the guidance that we’ve given.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Michael, I guess the last comment that I’d have on it, if the consumer softened in any way, I’ll bet on this team all day long to go after the business.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">No doubt. And Carol, you mentioned you are on your plan, do you mean you are on your plan where you stand quarter-to-date, such that you really haven't seen any impact from the tariffs flowing through to the consumer as of yet?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">That’s exactly what I mean. The beauty of our business is that we see sales on our phone; we can know exactly how we're doing by the minute. So, that’s very different than that leading indicator of remodeling activity report that you just mentioned, which is based on a biannual survey of housing data coming out of that [ph]. We have real data at our fingertips. So, we feel good about the performance.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">You might want to remove that app by the end of the month. And then, my last question is on as you look at your guidance for the back half of the year, how should we model gross margin and SG&amp;A, particularly between the third and the fourth quarter, recognizing that it’s not so straight forward, given that you’ll be lapping the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year? </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So, it’s a relatively loopy [ph]. So, I -- talked to expenses, and as we told you, we expect our expenses on a 52-week to 52-week basis, excluding the write-down that we took for some trade names that we’re no longer using. We told you that our expense growth factor would be 90% for the year. For the first half, it was around 73%. So, it will be a little bit higher in the back half, and quarter-over-quarter expect Q4 is higher than Q3. On the gross margin side, as we indicted, our gross margin -- it won’t be as low as we had anticipated at the beginning of the year because of the penetration shift in lumber. So, we will be slightly higher than our original guide, our original guide was to be flat or that was at 34% for the year as you move forward. So, it won't be down as much. So, the second half margin will be down as much as the first half.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">That’s helpful. Thanks again and best of luck.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And well done, Carol. Congratulations. My first question is on the second half. I know you don’t provide quarterly guidance, but can you can you share some cadence around the second half comp guidance, and its dependencies? And I'm thinking about macro dependencies and strategic initiatives. And if you can share with us part of it on the strategic initiatives, which ones are expected to contribute to the most for the second half comps?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Couple of things to think about when we think about the second half comp. First, as you know, we’re lapping $800 million of hurricane-related sales of which $500 million occurred in the first half, $300 million in the back half. So, the hurricane sales overlap is easier. Secondly, on lumber price deflation, let's just use the number of $800 million to make it simple, about $500 million of that occurred in the first half, so $300 million will occur in the back half. So, it is easier too. Then, we have the impact…</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. And so, on the initiatives, when you think about the Pro, first is the B2B website that we have launched. And we are seeing Pros that have been migrated onto a website, react very positively from a sales standpoint. We are on track for the 1 million Pros in 2019. As a matter of fact, at the tail end of this quarter, we added a significant number of Pros to the website.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As Ted detailed, My View capability that we've given to our associates in store to better understand how we can engage with a Pro customer is delivering the results as well. And then, we've made significant investments in our rental business, which we know is an important aspect with the Pro. 25% of the Pros rent from us today; we know that 90% of Pro is rent tools. So, we have an opportunity as we invest in this business to continue to grow.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then, in the digital investments, our HD Home program, as we expand categories to fulfill rooms in the home, as well as the investments we're making in search capabilities, category updates are all leading to improved sales and conversion in the business. And then, the number of investments that we've made in the store as well, whether that's our overhead management, which is driving productivity in the store, or interconnected lockers, which is enhancing the pickup experience for our customers or our merchandising resets are paying off in a nice way. I don’t know, do you want to give a little more color on the resets?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Ted Decker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. On the resets, we've been working on our appliance resets and our tools sales for some time. Those two businesses continue to post incredibly strong results, and we don't see that changing in the back half. More recently, we've been working through our pipe isle reset, which is going extremely well through about half the chain this year and that adds holding power and room for some new assortment programs. And then, soft flooring, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, for a while there you thought, hey, is soft flooring losing all ground to hard surface flooring, what we’ve seen in solid core vinyl and tile. But resetting all of our soft carpet showrooms, those are done. We simplified our brand structure. We simplified our line structure and pricing structures. That has continued to accelerate through the quarter and exited the quarter at much higher than the Company comp. So, we're happy with what we’ve seen in soft flooring. And then, lastly, our largest reset to come, which we've just launched in the last several weeks, and will finish the entire chain by the end of this year, is our new color solution center in our paint department where we’d be highlighting our Behr and PPG products, and really pleased with that. The timing couldn’t be better. We read a number of recent consumer surveys and consumer testing agencies, release the new winners for this year and Behr captured the top three paint products in the entire industry at the best value, and PPG posted the two top stain products at the best value. So, we’re very excited about all those resets.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And Craig, just to add a couple of points from just driving the customer experience as well. Number one, you mentioned rental. We’re continuing to see growth accelerate from half to half. So, the investments we’re making there are really driving exponential value. And so, we’re going to continue to lean in there. To the points about driving the event in the second half, when we think about our comp cadence, we kind of talked about overhead management and/or ability to find the product and get on-shelf availability to a very, very high level is driving incremental performance. And for us, as we think about the investments, not only to getting the product on the shelf, is how do we get the customers to the store. So, we have done 450 frontend transformations. We have heard the numbers that we have seen, just the customer experience grow across the board. We’re going to have over 800 by the end of the year. And so, we’re able to deliver this performance by not only transforming our business, but making sure that our focus is simple and direct and drive into where the customer expects us to be.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, we’ll continue to drive through that in the second half of the year and leverage the event to drive exponential depreciated performance.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. That was very comprehensive. Can I -- I am going to ask my follow-up. A year ago, when rates were rising, we went through this hypothetical scenario, if we saw recession, I think we talked about the scenario in which Home Depot would comp flat and margins could go to 12, if you made all the investments as part of your plan. I think, we’re now one year forward, you’re making progress on margins, can you provide us another update, would your margin end up better than that 12, given that you’re closer now to some of your goals?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Well, Simeon, we haven’t updated that recession model. Productivity is a virtuous cycle at The Home Depot. But for modeling, purposes, I reviewed the same numbers that we shared with you before. And just on the sort of the state of the economy and when a recession might happen, we certainly can’t predict that. But, we know a few things. We are in the longest economic recovery in our nation’s history. And yet the amount of growth during this recovery is still under the average of every other recovery industry. So, this is one reason why it’s been an elongated cycle. Further, share of housing as a percent of GDP has dropped, it’s about 19% of GDP. Back in 2006, it was about 22% GDP. So, whenever that downturn comes and it will, it is a cyclical economy. But, whenever that downturn comes, it’s not going to be like it was before. So, we’re very well positioned to manage through all that.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you, again, and best of luck.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning, guys. I had another follow-up on the investments that you’re making, despite the pretty comprehensive answer you already provided. Can you help us better understand the cadence of the comp growth improvement that you are expecting, both in the back half of this year and that flows into next year, specifically target to these investments.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">What we said in earlier statements that we believe that we will achieve about a 1% impact in the back half of the year from the investments that we are making. When you took GDP, the housing benefit, and then added in the investments, that’s how we got to our growth overall. And the only thing that changed from that for all practical purposes is the deflation of lumber.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Just to clarify I think it was 1.4 for the year, all of which is kind of loaded into the back half or did I misunderstand that?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">You are right. It’s loaded into the back half. And the way that we’ve modeled it based on events as well as the completion of resets that you’ve heard from Ted is that that the fourth quarter comp will be higher than third quarter, definitely.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Got it. And we should presume because of the changes in the customer interaction, a lot of these improvements should flow into next year, or is there a point where you start to anniversary it and it levels off?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">They’ll definitely flow into next year. We will get to that guidance later in the year.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And I’d certainly echo Craig’s comments and whish you, Carol, a very best of fortune in the next phase of your life. In terms of my questions, just a follow-up on the macro, on the housing front, rates have moved around a lot, moved down quite a bit. I’m about to reset perhaps personally, but pricing has moderated and existing home sales are not picking up. So, is that what you are expecting? And then, what are you seeing out there in terms of -- in the market, say, some of the coastal markets where we’re -- that’s really driving the deceleration in pricing and pricing coming down versus other parts of the country? And then, related to that on a consumer front, are you seeing anything different in the consumer around the type of projects that they're taking on or perhaps the trade-up versus the value orientation?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">On the macro model, yes, things are moving around a little bit, but it’s just on the margin. So, there is no material change to the inputs that create the output and drive our sales plan. To your question about the coastal markets, I’ll just give you some data. Let’s take San Francisco down the coast; the cost was higher than the Company average. Let's take San Diego little further south; comp was at the Company average. Let's take New Jersey, which is a high south state, the comps were higher than the company average. And then, let’s just land in Dallas. Dallas has seen a 54% increase in home prices since 2006 and it comped above the Company average. You can see things are performing the way that we thought they would.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Understood. And then, a couple of detailed model questions. First, any comment on your expectation for the U.S. comp for the year versus the 4% total guide? And can you help us a little bit more about on the SG&amp;A in 4Q? You give us 52-week to 52-week comparison, perhaps how much incremental SG&amp;A dollars there were in 4Q ‘18 related to that 53rd week?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">I don’t feel good about answering those questions because we don’t like to give you too much quarterly information....</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, the one comment I’d make as it relates to kind of the year, we're expecting positive comps in Canada for the year, if that helps.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">The question is what happens to the U.S. dollar, and we plan it currency neutral. So, you can model what you think is going to happen to the dollar and do that calculation. So, on the expense side on a reported basis, because of the extra week that expenses growth guidance on a GAAP basis looked really bloated. [Ph] And that's the only way to explain it It’s going to look really bloated. We're going to ignore that extra week. I think the best thing to do is just work within the annual guidance that we’ve given you, look at it on a daily 52-week to 52-week basis, and you can back into what the fourth quarter looks like.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, the front half of the year has not been kind on the weather front, we all know that at this point. I'm just curious, in the past, when you've seen this type of pattern, you typically see the release of that demand, or do some of the projects just get postponed or cancelled altogether?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">It's by category. So there's some categories that have the ability to extend and we're seeing that in the business right now. And so, you capture that. There are some where you don't recover all of that business. You might get part of it, but not all of it. So, it really varies by category. So, if you think about, depending on when the weather takes place, you may or may not get pre-emergent business back, for example, and this year, we didn't get that back.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then, just on the change in the comp guide. When you look ahead to your -- the long-term sales targets of $114.7 billion to I believe around $120 billion. I'm just wondering, if that changes that outlook at all, or maybe perhaps bring it to the lower end of the algo equation?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. It definitely goes to the lower end. But, it doesn't change the range of guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. And then, just one follow-up on the gross margins, Carol. All of last year, transportation was a pretty big headwind. You didn't call it out this quarter. I don't believe you called it out last quarter. I was just curious, if it's actually helping you guys at this point?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, it certainly has moderated from what we saw last year. What we are very excited about is the productivity that we’re seeing in our upstream supply chain. Our supply chain team has done a great job of mechanizing our upstream facilities. We actually -- well, I called out 2 basis points of pressure in the gross margin comps -- supply chain upstream. Upstream, we leveraged, we leveraged 6 basis points. So, tremendous, we leverage productivity in supply chain.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Zach Fadem</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Craig, you specifically called out some conservatism in your guide from the potential impact of tariffs. Curious if you could quantify the assumptions here in a little more detail. Maybe talk us through how you think about the balance in the back half of raising prices and the potential downtick in volumes as a result.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. I mean, the uncertainty is what the total impact on the customers economically overall. When we look at it specifically as it relates to Home Depot, if you think about China tariffs list one through four, four being at 10%, that's about a $2 billion or 2% of sales cost impact. And so, the way you have to think about tariffs is there's really two sides that you work on this. There's the actual cost side and there is a number of initiatives underway there, and then, there is the potential of the impact to the customers that relates to the project. And, I can -- I’ll let Ted talk about the cost side. And we have a number of initiatives underway as it relates to how we flow things through to the customer. We use our portfolio approach. We think about this business as a project business, which it is. And there’s clearly ups and downs and elasticity, but we have pretty good tools for merchants to use on that. And we’ve actually been able to cover the top line.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Ted, if you want to talk about the cost side?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Ted Decker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. I’d say on the cost side, I couldn’t be happier with our partnership with finance team, the accounting team, our assortment planning team. We have data of country, of origin in potential tariff impact literally down to skew. So, we know exactly what are on various lists, when the tariff impacts will hit. We even know that through our retail accounting into when the impacts hit in our P&amp;L. So, thank you very much to the great partnership with the finance team.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As Craig said, on a macro perspective, through phase 4, and phase 4 only being a 10%, it’s a potential impact of about 2% of our U.S. sales. Now, with a number of activities that we’re working with the merchants between negotiations with our supplier base taking into account things like currency, trends for pricing in the United States, value engineering, we’re embarking upon with our suppliers, with customer-backed research if you have marginal dollar to put into the product, where you put it, the best customer value. And then, we’re starting to see significant supply chain. I would say, on the margin, I'm not aware of a single supplier who is not moving some form of manufacturing outside of China. So, we have suppliers moving production to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Thailand, Indonesia and even back into the United States. So, when you net all of that out, we see this 2ish-percent impact being much, much less, call it something like 1%. And then, as Craig said, it’s up to the merchant team to work with our overall portfolio approach to the business and project approach to the business to see how best if at all, there we pass on any of those net impacts to our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Zach Fadem</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Got it. And then, on the paint category, it seems to have gotten a little more promotional so far this year. Could we talk through some of the dynamics here? What do you think has driven the elevated activity, more so overall demand or weather environment? And maybe also talk through your process when deciding how you respond when you typically see changes out there in the pricing environment?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, first I’d answer with exterior stains. So, Behr is the -- the weather improved and we did the reset quickly last year and much more comprehensively this year, again with the number one and number two graded exterior stain with PPG product. We saw great performance in our exterior stain business. On interior paint, interior paint has gotten more promotional in the marketplace. We have folks out there advertising in print and on media as much as 40% off. At Home Depot, we have, as was just released with the third party agencies, we have the absolute best paint in marketplace. Behr paint holds the top three slots in its ratings in two different surveys. And we are not going to fall into a high-low promotional trap when we have the best product at the best everyday value. And as you know in the finance community, just speaking of promotional cadence, I can remember there was a lot of talk about breaking the buck in the money market world. And we had a 3 times a year promotional cadence in paint of $10 off a gallon and $40 off 5 gallons in the major holidays of the year. Some of our competitors chose to break the buck, and we're not going to do that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Karen Short</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Just a question on tariffs in general. So, I think, last quarter you commented that on price, raising prices as it relates to tariff impacted pricing, you initially had negative units on appliances and then demand picked up a bit. Maybe a little color on what you are seeing in terms of the consumer reaction to higher price points? And then, I just had a clarification question on the gross margin.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">As we -- as I mentioned, we have number of models that we are working right now. And it varies by category. There is elasticity variance by category, and that changes over time as well. And the work that we’ve done, we’ve been able to actually cover the total top line sales in the models that we have out there. And when you think about laundry because we have referenced that from the past, as time has gone by, laundry was actually our highest unit comping category in appliances last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Karen Short</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Interesting, okay. That’s helpful. And then, on the gross margin front, I mean, obviously, lumber would have been a benefit to gross margin this quarter. Could you quantify that and then help walk us through how lumber may impact gross margin in the second half?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I’m happy to. With the lower penetration of lumber in the second quarter, it gave us 15 basis points of margin expansion. But, that was absorbed by growth in lower margin categories, like appliances as well as portable power. We love our portable power sales, but we don’t make a lot of money on it. So...</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Ted Decker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It started recovery, in general. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. Absolutely, Ted. Thank you for that. So, as we look to the back half of the year, we would expect lumber to stay down as we’ve talked about, not much as you saw in the first half, but down, which will give us some benefit for the back half as well for the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Forbes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I wanted to revisit the tool rental business and really what you expect the B2B website experience to augment this initiative? As I sort of think about it, maybe you could just expand on how you view the interplay between those two initiatives and the potential impact of Pro engagement trends. You mentioned sort of positive, but can you provide some additional color?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, I’d say, first comment I make, I'll turn it over to Ann, is right now, our issues aren’t around necessarily connecting the B2B website to that from a digital experience. That will come at a later date. This is all about the investments that we're making right now in the physical locations.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Ann-Marie Campbell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. And just to support, Craig, on that. Number one, the first thing we're doing investing capital in the business. To your point, there's -- when we invest in fleet, we’re able to drive more engagement with the Pro, because we have product available. So that's the first thing we're doing is making sure that we have the right assortment for Pro. The number two thing we're doing there as well to drive the experience. We've had just tremendous success with the label model we introduced in the stores last year and it was able to drive higher level of engagement by having our associates there at the right time to engage our customer. And so, we're going to continue to lean into that. And within the two rental areas, we're also making sure that we're addressing our label model to ensure as well that we are having a high level of engagement as well there. And then, last but not least, as we think about how do we ensure that we expand our offering, and we're able to push into areas at this point to delivery service and so forth, we're exploring hub locations for tool rental as well. So, we're going to continue to push there. We're seeing tremendous growth. We’re seeing higher levels of engagement. And we believe as we continue to expand, it will certainly be a complement for Pros and drive loyalty within the Home Depot.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Forbes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. And then, just a quick follow-up, maybe just a modeling question here. You called out the strategic investment, dollar impact for the quarter and year-to-date. But, are you still on track to expense, I think it was $550 million for D&amp;A for the year. Maybe just give us an update on where you are and what the full-year outlook incorporates?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. We are on our plan with regard to both the expense and capital in support of our strategic investments.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I wanted to follow up on deflation. You discussed the lumber impact. I'm just curious about net deflation, if there were any positive commodity price movements. And I guess just how are you thinking about that as part of the new full-year comp guidance?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, lumber deflation, I said was 110 basis points. And then, we had another 10 basis points of inflation, if you will, from the other commodities categories that we call out from time to time. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then, ex the deflation, your average ticket actually accelerated in the quarter versus last quarter. So, I guess outside of commodities, how do we think about the average price increase that you're seeing across the store, I guess, on a same SKU basis? And then, tying it in with the gross margin to the extent that you are seeing higher retail prices, is that a benefit to the gross margin initially until the higher costs actually start to flow through cogs, like how we do think about that? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, on the price side, and I'll let Ted give details. The innovation that comes into the assortments, certainly has a positive impact overall on our business as it relates to the ticket.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Ted Decker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. And I would say from taking aside lumber and tariffs, from a pure commodity standpoint, we had quite a bit of pressure on back half of last year, first part of this year that subsided. So, commodity prices generally versus a year ago, if you think of steel, resin, base metals et cetera are actually down. So, that pressure on the outfit has subsided.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">To Craig’s point, most of our pricing increases are mix-driven in the sense that customers are trading up to more innovative, higher price goods, we break out the components of our average unit retail increase, which has increased. By far the largest driver of that in Q2 as well as the past several quarters is from new product introductions which are higher price points because of innovation, think of cordless lawnmowers versus push gas mowers.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">On tariffs, we have a number of tests going on across the country, nothing of any sort of magnitude to say in the quarter, we’re taking price broadly at this point because of tariffs. But we are testing a number of things in our mixes and portfolio approach across the country.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And to your question, impact to margin. As we sell more innovative product and the customer steps themselves lot off that line structure it drives a higher gross margins dollar. It may not change rate, but it drives the higher gross margin dollar, which is what the most important thing is.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And we’re probably not giving you the information that maybe you wanted, but I think it’s been an interest statistics to look at the acceleration in our big ticket. This has been underlying sign of health in the business. This is unadjusted. Big ticket grew 1.5% in May, 4.1% in June and 5.3% in July. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Isabel Janci</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Christine, we have time for one more question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Greg Melich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I made it in. So, Carol, thank you. It really, really helped through all the years. And you enjoy all the break you get, we’ll continue to annoy you as best we can. I had a follow-up on tariffs and inflation and then also digital. If -- that description you gave before of list 1 to 4, does that assume a 10% tariff on everything, a 25% or is it 25% on lists 1 to 3 and then the potential 10 on list 4?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. That’s exactly right. It’s the 25 of 1 through 3 and then 10 on 4.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Greg Melich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Perfect. And so, to tie into that, is that a reason why inventories might have been up 5% year-over-year, a contributing factor?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">No, our inventory is all about the investments that we’re making in the accelerated resets for the large part. So, it has nothing to do with that.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Greg Melich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Got it. And then, last on digital. I know up 20% continues to grow nicely. Is that around 9% of sales? And it did decelerate. So, I'm wondering, did Amazon’s move to next day, did you see any impact on that? And do you think that was the factor in the deceleration or is there something else going on?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Craig Menear</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">No. We actually were very pleased with our growth; it’s 8.9% penetration in the quarter, up from 7.5% a year ago. And we’ve actually accelerated our capabilities in same day delivery. Mark, I don’t know if you want to share the details on that? </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Holifield</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. As was noted earlier, we have expanded our next day parcel coverage. We’re over 50% of the population now in next day parcel coverage. We’ve expanded our car delivery also to greater than 50% out of our stores. So, we’re pleased with the time we’re taking out of our lead time to customer. We continue to take lead time out with every move we make in the supply chain, and each time we do, it improves conversion.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carol Tomé</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Just on the point on deceleration, it’s a fiscal calendar shift thing. So, that’s not a comp number; that’s a growth number.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Ms. Janci, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Isabel Janci</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.</p>]"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now I'll turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma’am, you may begin.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Patricia Murphy</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I want to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Presentation. I’m here with Jim Kavanaugh, IBM’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We’ll post today’s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company’s SEC filings.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. We’ve provided reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">So with that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jim Kavanaugh</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. In the second quarter, we delivered $19.2 billion of revenue, $2.8 billion of operating net income and $3.17 of operating earnings per share, which was up 3%. We expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points, which is the largest increase in over five years and operating net income margin by 60 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And we had solid free cash flow performance, with $12.7 billion of free cash flow over the last year. These results reflect improving fundamentals of our ongoing business. And now with this performance through the second quarter, we remain on track to deliver at least $13.90 of operating EPS and about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">This excludes Red Hat and related activity, but we believe this remains a relevant perspective as it provides transparency into our underlying business performance and is on a base that’s consistent with our previous guidance and first half performance. But to be clear, Red Hat is not included in any of the operating results we're discussing today and we will update our full year expectations to include Red Hat during our Investor webcast on August 2.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Over the last few quarters, we've talked about strong performance in the areas that help our clients with their digital transformations and journeys to cloud. This continued in the second quarter, as evidenced by strong revenue performance across the high-value segments of Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software and Global Business Services.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our results also reflect significant actions we've taken to improve our position over time. For example, at the end of the second quarter, we completed the divestiture of select software assets that didn't leverage our integrated value proposition and we took workforce actions to continue to revitalize our skill base and address stranded costs associated with the divested businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And as you have likely seen just eight days ago, we completed the acquisition of Red Hat. This acquisition is an important milestone for IBM and one that will significantly impact the cloud landscape. It is clear that the next chapter of cloud will be about shifting mission-critical work to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems. This requires a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach to provide portability, management consistency, and security for these enterprise workloads.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We've been building hybrid cloud capabilities across our business to address this opportunity and to prepare for this moment, bringing to market innovations like IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Private, the Cloud Migration Factory, Cloud Application Innovation, IBM Garages, IBM Multicloud Manager, and Cloud Optimized Systems with tens of thousands of cloud architects.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">These innovations helped to drive IBM's $19.5 billion of cloud revenue over the last 12 months, which is up 8% led by mid-teens growth in our as-a-service capabilities all at constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">This is why leading enterprises across industries that range from banking to transportation, to telecom are using IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities to improve the management and delivery of their data.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">You saw in yesterday's announcement, IBM will modernize and move AT&amp;T's business solutions applications to the IBM Cloud, while collaborating on an edge computing platform for their enterprise clients. AT&amp;T will also leverage Red Hat's open-source platform to manage workloads and applications in AT&amp;T's network cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">And so now with the acquisition of Red Hat, we'll be combining the power and flexibility of Red Hat's open hybrid cloud technologies with the scale and depth of IBM's innovation and industry expertise.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In short, IBM and Red Hat will be better together, accelerating our clients' journey to the cloud and lifting all of IBM as we grow Red Hat and sell more software and services.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">You'll see our cloud capabilities contributed to our broader segment results in the second quarter. As usual, I'll use constant currency growth rates throughout. Our Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software revenue performance this quarter was strong, up 5% at constant currency. Our Cloud &amp; Cognitive growth was broad-based across all three business lines led by hybrid cloud offerings and security.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Global Business Services grew about 3.5%, and here too, we had good growth across all three lines of business, as we help our clients on their digital journeys and to modernize and migrate applications to the cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In Global Technology Services, our profit dynamics continue to improve with gross margin up 120 basis points and modest pretax profit growth, excluding workforce action.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The margin expansion reflects our focus on exiting lower-value content in driving productivity and cloud scale efficiencies. While GTS revenue declined due in part to this portfolio focus, we had good growth in the services that help our clients implement and manage hybrid multicloud environments.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As expected, our Systems revenue was down, reflecting the product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and the related high-end Storage, while Power continued to grow. When we bring all this together, our revenue was $19.2 billion, which was down about 1.5% and that includes a 40 basis point impact from the divested businesses, which had been declining.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As you look at our key financial metrics, you can see the improved fundamentals of our business with revenue growth in the higher value segments, gross and net margin expansion and solid free cash flow generation.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our operating gross margin was up 100 basis points, driven by a combination of our strong software revenue growth, services productivity and cloud scale efficiencies. And our operating expense was flat year-to-year. We continue to drive efficiency and productivity in our spending, so our base expense was up this quarter as we invested ahead of Red Hat and in development ahead of our next generation IBM Z later this year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">And so, now looking at our pretax income, the year-to-year performance is driven by the operational declines in our now divested businesses. Excluding these impacts, we delivered solid pre-tax operating leverage, reflecting our gross margin expansion, partially offset by the investments I just mentioned.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our operating tax rate in the quarter was 11% including discrete items. This is right in line with the full year all-in tax rate of 11% to 12%, we talked about in January. Pulling it all together, our operating earnings per share was up 3% and that includes a $0.15 year-to-year impact from the operational declines of our now divested businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Looking at our cash metrics, the $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter is up $500 million over last year. As I've said, we generated $12.7 billion over the last 12 months, so good solid cash generation.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now, let me come back to expense to talk about a couple of items. First, currency helped our year-to-year expense dynamics due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. In fact, $120 million of the year-over-year change in other income and expense was due to hedging benefits. As always, these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout our P&amp;L.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Second, within expense as expected, we also had gains and charges that together were effectively neutral to the bottom line. I just mentioned the operational impact of our divested businesses in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let me comment on the transactional impact. We closed the two software divestitures at the end of the second quarter, resulting in about $575 million of one-time gains in other income. This is within the range of $500 million to $700 million we provided back in April.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Within SG&amp;A, also as expected, we took actions to revitalize skills and address structure and stranded costs associated with these divestitures, resulting in a workforce related charge of about $500 million. We also took a charge for an unfavorable legal ruling received in late June on a case that has been under dispute for nearly a decade.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And so together, these gains and charges were essentially neutral to our total expense and to our profit growth in the period. So as I have said in the past, the divestitures will improve our revenue and profit profile on a go-forward basis.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to our segments. Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software delivered strong revenue performance this quarter, up 5%. We had growth across all three areas with cloud and data platforms up 7%; Cognitive Applications up 5%; and transaction processing platforms up 4%. Our software offerings helped our clients securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on-premises and on private and public clouds.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In cloud and data platforms, we had broad-based growth led by several newer offerings throughout the portfolio that help clients modernize their applications for hybrid cloud environments and their data for AI. We continue to see good hybrid cloud growth this quarter, as client's leverage our reliable and scalable IBM Cloud Private solution built on open-source frameworks like Containers and Kubernetes.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">SK Group in South Korea turn to IBM Cloud Private to quickly and easily package applications as Containers and re-factor them with IBM micro services across their businesses. Their new SK telecom portal used by customers to buy mobile services is now running on the IBM Cloud Private platform. And our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering, which collects, organizes and analyzes data for AI also delivered strong growth this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We launched this solution just a year ago, and we've had strong client adoption, in fact, growing our installed base nearly 40%, since first quarter. Cognitive Applications' revenue growth was led by strong performance in our integrated security software and services portfolio, and growth across many of our industry vertical solutions.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Let me spend a minute on security. We continue to see strong performance in our threat management software and services offerings, including QRadar and Resilient, as well as in managed security intelligence solutions like X-Force Threat Management. And as clients look to safeguard critical data and data warehouses and big data environments, we had good traction in our Guardium data security solutions. With 95% of the top global companies leveraging IBM Security solutions, we are well positioned as an industry leader.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to transaction processing platforms. Growth was driven by strong performance in IBM Z middleware, as clients continue to predictably manage IT spending for their growing IBM Z mission-critical workloads. And then moving to profit for this segment, pretax margin was up 2 points year-to-year, and that's excluding the impact from the workforce actions this quarter. Margins reflect strong transactional performance in high-value areas offset by ongoing investment in key strategic areas, including the preparation for the Red Hat closing.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Moving to Global Business Services, revenue was up 3%. We again had good growth as enterprise continue their digital reinvention journeys to become Cloud &amp; Cognitive enterprises. GBS is at the epicenter of IBM, bringing both business and technology transformation solutions to clients. They bring together deep industry expertise, IBM's innovative technology portfolio, and third-party information technology architectures to deliver differentiated value to enterprises. We see evidence in this in all three areas of GBS, as consulting revenue grew 5%, application management grew 2% and Global Process Services grew 3%. In consulting, growth was led by sustained performance in our next-gen enterprise apps like S/4HANA and in Digital Strategy and iX offerings.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">At Wimbledon, our Digital Strategy and iX team delivered a differentiated and personalized digital experience to on-site media, players and fans around the world, leveraging AI and running on the IBM Cloud supported by GTS. Clients are also leveraging the IBM Garage to help them power their digital reinventions with hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, while going from idea generation to enterprise scale adoption.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">ADP used IBM Garage method to infuse AI across the enterprise. ADP and IBM jointly developed an AI-powered digital agent that handles over 20% of ADP's chat traffic, which helped drive Net Promoter Scores to all-time highs. Today, ADP continues to work with GBS to help create its digital onboarding process, streamlining and enhancing their new client’s first impressions. In the past 18 months, IBM has helped more than 500 leading global companies use the IBM Garage, to drive digital transformations with data in AI on the cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">GBS is becoming the provider of choice for clients across the various phases of their journey to cloud, whether it's advising, moving, building or managing their applications and processes. For example, GBS is working with another leading telco provider to advice on their digital transformation journey to the cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As part of this, IBM will develop and manage a center of excellence that will power an enterprise-wide Red Hat Ansible implementation for hybrid and multicloud platforms. This will enable them to transform their product and technology organization, support an agile DevOps culture for its developer teams, while moving its application portfolio to the cloud to reduce complexity and accelerate delivery and time to value.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And at Fortum, a Finnish energy company, we're leveraging our Cloud Migration Factory to advise the company on its cloud strategy, as well as helping to migrate and manage its applications to the cloud. Cloud Migration Factory is one of the areas contributing to our growth in application management revenue this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to profit. GBS gross margin was essentially flat, with contribution from continued mixed shift to higher-value offerings and from currency given our global delivery mix. This was offset by a higher level of skill capacity investments to capture demand around Red Hat and digital reinvention.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 4%, with infrastructure and cloud services down 4%, and technology support services down 2%, while gross margin for this segment expanded 120 basis points. As we said over the last few quarters, we are managing this business for increased margin, profit and cash contribution to better position it for the long-term.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As part of that, we have been taking actions to deemphasize lower-value contracts and third-party content and focus our investments on the higher value segments of the IT market such as hybrid cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">This contributes to lower GTS revenue in the short-term, but will enable us to deliver sustained margin improvement. You saw this play out again in the second quarter with our gross margin expansion driven by scale efficiencies in our cloud, productivity improvement as we infuse AI and automation into our service delivery models, and the shift of our business to higher value areas.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">This quarter, GTS delivered just under $0.5 billion of pretax profit and modest PTI growth, both adjusted for the workforce-related charge. We are going to leverage this improved profit position to continue to invest in our go-to-market and delivery capabilities to capture this high-value and growing market.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Enterprises continue to turn to IBM to navigate and manage the increased complexities of a hybrid multicloud world. IBM services is in a unique position to help our clients in chapter two as we have been running these workloads and we know their processes as well as their IT and regulatory environments.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As I mentioned earlier, at the end of June, we signed an agreement with AT&amp;T which spans both of our services businesses. In this multiyear strategic agreement, IBM will modernize and migrate AT&amp;T business solutions and applications to the IBM Cloud and will help manage the entire IT infrastructure on and off-premises and across different clouds, private and public.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">By leveraging a hybrid multicloud approach, enterprises can not only reduce costs and complexity, they can modernize, build, deploy, and run core business applications in a faster and more secure way. This approach will enable AT&amp;T business to build and deploy any app or workload anywhere and deliver new innovative services to its business customers. This is a great example of how we're helping clients accelerate their journey to hybrid cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And now turning to Systems, revenue was down 18% this quarter. We again had growth in Power. This was more than offset by declines in IBM Z and storage, reflecting the late stage of our z14 product cycle. In the second quarter, IBM Z revenue declined 41%. I'll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the second quarter last year, where we grew 112%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We announced the z14 program two years ago now and our revenue is tracked ahead of the prior program throughout that period. We continue to see clients take advantage of the value of z14 such as pervasive encryption and connecting to the cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And so from a Malaysian bank securing and improving performance on core banking workloads to a European tax office implementing a private cloud solution on Linux to manage new applications, clients appreciate the z14 innovation. In today's environment, there's a lot of demand for technology underpinned by data protection and resiliency with the ability to integrate across cloud environments and we will continue to innovate in these areas, which are core to the IBM Z value proposition.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Power revenue was up 3%, again led by POWER9. We had continued growth in high-end offerings and in Linux with HANA on Power, leveraging our performance of POWER9. This is the same architecture used with Summit and Sierra, which are among the world's largest scientific and AI computing systems.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As a reminder, we started the delivery of these supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy Labs in the second quarter of last year and essentially completed the deployment through the second half of 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">This quarter, we also announced that IBM Power Systems virtual servers are now available in the IBM Cloud, providing clients with hybrid, cloud scale of compute for AIX and IBM i workloads. Our enterprise clients are increasingly looking to adopt hybrid cloud strategies, backed by their performance, resiliency and security capabilities of IBM POWER9 to help optimize everything from supply chains to sales.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In Storage, revenue was down 21%, reflecting the clients on our high-end, which is tied to our mainframe cycle and the ongoing competitive dynamics and pricing pressures in the midrange. Looking at Systems profit, gross profit margin expanded across the portfolio, while pre-tax margin was down, reflecting where we are in the Z product cycle.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We've now generated $12.7 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months. Our normalized free cash flow realization over that period remains high at 118%. In the second quarter, we generated $2.8 billion cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and $2.4 billion of free cash flow. That brings our free cash flow for the first half to $4.1 billion, which is up about $900 million year-to-year. These results reflect our operational performance and effective capital management.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our strategy to deemphasize lower value content across our services and financing portfolios continue to play out in cash and contributed to our CapEx spending decline for the half. Capital expenditures also reflect the benefit from a real estate sale of about $270 million, although there was effectively no P&amp;L benefit. I'll remind you that the proceeds from the divestitures are considered an investing activity, so are not included in our free cash flow.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Looking at uses of cash. So far this year, we returned over $4 billion to our shareholders. $2.8 billion of that was dividend and in April, we again raised our dividend. That's now the 24th consecutive year; we've taken our dividend up. Through the first half, we spent $1.2 billion on gross share repurchases buying back more than 9 million shares.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With the closing of the Red Hat transaction, we suspended our share repurchase program on July 9th.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $46 billion in cash, approximately $34 billion of that was used to close the Red Hat transaction earlier this month.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our total debt was $73 billion including incremental debt raised to fund the Red Hat acquisition. About a third of our total debt is in support of our financing business, which continues to be levered at a ratio of 9:1. Our global financing debt is down over $6 billion from December, reflecting the portfolio decisions we made regarding the financing of third-party content. These decisions also led to further improvement in the credit quality of our financing portfolio, which is now 57% investment grade, 3 points better than a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So to sum this up, we continue to generate strong free cash flow. And together, with the portfolio actions we've taken, and the suspension of share repurchases positions us to return to our targeted leverage ratios within a couple of years. In the meantime, our balance sheet is strong with the flexibility to support our business.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So I'll make a few summary comments in the quarter, before we move on to Q&amp;A. In the second quarter, our performance reflects the value we provide in helping our clients with their digital transformations and journey to cloud. We see this across our business in our hybrid cloud offerings and services, our data and AI capabilities, and in areas like security.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We had significant gross margin expansion and solid free cash flow, a reflection of the improving fundamentals of our business. And we continued our focus on investment prioritization and portfolio optimization, closing the pending software divestitures, deemphasizing lower-value content in GTS, and continuing to wind down our OEM commercial financing portfolio. All of these improved our profit profile going forward. And of course, just eight days ago, we completed the acquisition of Red Hat, a landmark acquisition that has important implications to the cloud landscape and to IBM.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now, let me make a few things very clear before we go into Q&amp;A. This quarter, we're in a unique position due to the timing of the Red Hat acquisition. And so today, I won't address any questions on forward-looking guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As mentioned, we will be updating our full year 2019 expectations on August 2, which will include the impact of Red Hat. As you would expect with a highly profitable software business, the non-cash purchase accounting adjustments result in the acquisition being dilutive to full year 2019 earnings per share. We have said this, and also that we continue to expect Red Hat to be accretive to operating earnings per share by the end of the second year, and accretive to free cash flow in the first full year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And so now, I'm happy to take your questions about our second quarter performance and the trends we are seeing in our underlying business excluding Red Hat.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Patricia Murphy</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&amp;A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let's please open it up for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, the phone lines are now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question in queue is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks a lot. I was wondering, Jim, since I know we'll touch on Red Hat and the aggregate IBM in more detail on August 2, perhaps we'd spend some time on the services business. And when I look at the trajectory of services, I think GBS was up 4% in the first half, GTS was down 3%. How do you see the services business transpire as we go forward through 2019? And finally, maybe help me understand, what changed in your perspective on the company’s services versus [Technical Difficulty] ago?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. Thanks, Amit, and it's a very nice to hear from you again and welcome back. Let's talk about services and allow me to break it into two, because you're asking both the GTS side of the business and the GBS side of the business, because they have two fundamentals that are happening against each other.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">On one, we've been talking about -- let's talk about GTS first. We've been talking about the portfolio prioritization work that we've been doing about exiting lower-value content, which we've said all along would impact revenue in the near term, but result in higher margins in a better business profile going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And I think you're seeing that play out in our first half performance. Revenue in the second quarter, pretty consistent with the first quarter overall, but our margins, our operating leverage we are seeing substantial leverage in that business as we move forward because we said we were going to shift that business to higher value margin, profit and cash. And we were up 120 basis points, really led by that mix shift to getting away from lower-value content deemphasizing that, but also with our productivity initiatives which are executing well and delivering very good return on investment.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now with regards to GTS, what do we learn about the first half performance? And how does it impact the trajectory going into second half with regards to what did we learn? Well, I would tell you right now, based on where our backlog dynamics are and in particular, our backlog run-out, we see an inflection point as we enter the second half in GTS.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We're coming off the first half down 3.5%. Most of that being driven by conscious strategy as I talked about, but now we're going to wrap on that strategy as we enter later half of the second -- second half of 2019 and we're also beginning to ramp on a very strong large deals signings at the end of 4Q 2018 as we move forward.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, we feel very good about our book of business in GTS. We got through this conscious strategy. It's given us tremendous margin leverage, tremendous free cash flow leverage and we returned that business back to profitability in the first half and we see both margin improvement and sustainability. And we see that inflection point with an improvement in sequential year-to-year performance.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">On GBS, the team has done a great job. We have repositioned the portfolio, redesigned our service lines. We are driving growth across all three platforms, digital, cloud, cognitive as we enable our clients to really drive their digital reinvention journeys for the cloud and journeys to the cognitive enterprise.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">As we look at the end of the first half, when we look at our backlog run-out, our backlog run-out says, we’re going to have consistent growth as we move into third quarter. We're coming off of a pretty good signings quarter with GBS and a very strong continuation in small and mid-sized deals that are fueling our revenue in period.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, we feel pretty good about sustainability of that growth coming off the first half in GBS. And we see that marked inflection on a sequential year-to-year improvement in GTS as we exit the second -- enter the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Amit. Ted, can we please take the next question?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. The next question is from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt Cabral</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. Really robust growth in cloud and data platforms in the quarter. You talked about that a little bit in your prepared remarks, just wondering if you could dig deeper on what drove the acceleration, and how we should think about some of the buckets underneath there and how they performed? And then just the sustainability of that strength going forward?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay Matt. Thank you very much. Yes, we're obviously very pleased with our Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software business here in the second quarter. And most importantly, as you all know quite well we'll spend a lot more time on August 2nd talking about IBM plus Red Hat and how we're better together and how it's going to change the cloud landscape in this $1 trillion hybrid cloud market.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Red Hat will be part of this segment overall in Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software. But if you look at the second quarter, I think there's a perfect instantiation of where client demand is going. And when you got a differentiated value propositions and strong portfolio and offerings and a lineup and you execute well, you start seeing the leverage in acceleration and that's what we got out of the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We're helping our clients as they move their hybrid cloud applications to the cloud and also on data and AI. So, cloud and data platform, strong growth, up 7%, strong adoption in our ICP IBM Cloud Private, up 50% quarter-over-quarter in adoption rates.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But we're also seeing very good growth in our integration offerings and our hybrid cloud data platforms that are driving both our data, our analytics, and our AI capability going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But also across the other platform Cognitive Applications, we saw a good growth of 5% driven by a very good quarter in our integrated security software and services business as we launched new offerings around identity management, around threat management.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And we've got a very differentiated value proposition and we're executing well, but we also had very good growth across in some industry verticals led by supply chain in IoT; offerings around Maximo, which we've got a very strong incumbency with our clients in delivering value and also in weather.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Weather has consistently driven good growth for us. And I would tell you this quarter the Weather app in India became the number one downloaded app for the first time ever in India and that couples with already being number one downloaded app in the United States here.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So, we're seeing good growth across many of our verticals and across our cloud and data platform and this really establishes the foundation and we couldn't be more excited with Red Hat coming onboard July 8th.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Matt. Can we please take the next question?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. The next question in queue is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Wamsi Mohan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Thank you. Jim, can you talk about the overall enterprise demand environment as we look into the back half of the year, given some of the global uncertainties around?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Wamsi, we lost you there. Wamsi? Operator, it sounds like we lost him. Can we please go to the next question?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Thank you. Jim, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about GBS particularly on the profitability side. That business includes tech support services, which historically have had extremely high margins. And if you back that out, it's pointing the infrastructure and cloud services margins that are probably pretty close to zero. You have peers like DXC who have double-digit margins in that business, peers like Accenture who have double-digit margins in that business.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So one, can you address why the margin gap is so significant? And two, I heard your earlier comments about an inflection point, but I struggle a little bit given that signings are down 17% in the first half. Your backlog is down 4%, which I think is the worst in the last 20 years year-over-year. And so if I look at leading indicators, they actually don't look really good from a revenue perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Going forward, I realize your comps get a lot easier, but is -- are you really seeing an inflection? And what's the disconnect between the backlog and signings data that we're seeing and your optimism? And how do margins improve when the business is de-scaling?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay, Tony, thank you for your questions, multiple part. Lot packed in there, but let me just try to hit some of these head on. First of all, when you look at our GTS segment, it fits into the overarching integrated value of the IBM portfolio. There's components within our TSS segment that play to our Systems platforms in our business and drive tremendous integrated value.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And our Infrastructure Services segment, obviously, plays a tremendous value to IBM's integrated model with their deep client relationships where we leverage the value of incumbency and we actually drive as channel high-value software and hardware into those businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So I'm not going to talk about the individual profitability of those two pieces, because we manage this as an integrated play across IBM. But what I will talk about and I did see your report is that I view this as we have tremendous headroom to grow our margins, which is what we are maniacally focused on in this business about selling high-value, which is part of our conscious strategy of exiting and deemphasizing our low-value third-party OEM; and by the way in the first half you see how that has played out in our results.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our margins are up very strong, 120 basis points, and our pre-tax margins x the charges, so you can look at it on a sustainable basis going forward are up in the second quarter, and they're up through the first half. And I didn't even talk about the level of cash contribution that this business now is spewing off.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So we are very pleased with the business model, the trajectory and the value of what GTS brings to us. And I would agree with you completely, that we got headroom and that's what the teams focused on driving moving forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now with regards to your services, signings and backlog. We've been talking about at least for multiple quarters about the changing dynamics of signings and backlog in this environment. Part of that is the changing client demand and buying behaviors. Part of that is a shift to as-a-service in cloud. But as you stated, our signings were down in the quarter. Our backlog, absolute backlog is down, but I will remind everyone its $111 billion overall, that backlog is down mainly driven by large deals to your point.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Now, when you look at large deals, our large deals in the quarter were down by 20%. But, over the trailing 12 months, our large deals are actually flat, up in GTS as we sell that integrated outsourcing value, and actually down in GBS as the application management service is moving much quicker to the cloud, which is why we've been re-architecting our offerings around application management, modernization, migration services.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But as I said before, and I'm giving increased transparency and disclosure for our investors, signings are not all equal. Signings vary and they vary based on how they influence backlog duration, erosion, mix of signings, new logo. And for increased disclosure, when we look at our backlog run-out, which is right in front of us right now, that gives us confidence to talk about the inflection point in GTS as we wrap on this de-emphasis on lower-value content and we start ramping up our large deals from fourth quarter, which will start in the second half. So we see that inflection on a sequential year-to-year. And around GBS, we see continued momentum as we move forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks. Ted, can we please go to the next question?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Katy Huberty</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, thank you. Jim, this is the second quarter of strong gross margin expansion. I know, there is a number of factors helping you on that front. But if you isolate the cloud business, is it fair to say that you have escaped velocity, meaning cloud margins are improving sequentially with scale every quarter? Or should we think about cloud still having some lumpiness and seasonality around margins?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you, Katy. Yes, very good question overall. Last year, we talked about in the beginning of 2018, how we were investing significantly in building out our cloud architecture. In fact, our capital spend last year was up 70% as we built out six new MZR's around the world in which today our cloud architecture is very competitive and it covers 95%-plus of the demand from a cloud market overall.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But as we talk about throughout 2018, and now definitely into the first half of 2019, we are seeing continued scale efficiencies around our cloud as we generate more and more scale, as we're starting to drive the utilization around our cloud pods around the world and as we've – obviously, leveraging the differentiated value proposition and growing our cloud business, which is now $19.5 billion over a trailing 12 months. So we feel pretty good. And you see that play out in our GTS segment, which is consistently been accelerating their year-over-year margins up 110 basis points in the first quarter and up 120 basis points in the second quarter. And as you all know, that's well in excess to their model, but my answer to the last question, we believe we've got a lot of headroom.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. Thanks. Can we please go to the next question?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. The next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Tien-Tsin are you on mute?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Tien-Tsin Huang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">…transactional sales. How did that -- or transaction activity how did that perform versus planned versus the first quarter? Curious if it had any positive contributions to segment and obviously gross margin as well? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>A – Jim Kavanaugh</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, Tien-Tsin. I appreciate the question, because obviously given a seasonality of our business, as you all know, the transactional component is a very important part of our second quarter and also fourth quarter, overall. But let me put it in perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">90 days ago, we sat here and we talked about coming off of first quarter, that we were going to grow sequentially $900 million to $1 billion of revenue and that was going to be driven off of the back of our transactional-related business. We actually delivered at the high-end of that coming in at roughly the $19.2 billion overall. But the underpinnings are a little different.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">To the earlier question, we had very strong growth in our Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software segment that was pervasive across each of our platforms and that was mainly driven by leveraging our differentiated value proposition and strength of our offering portfolio and accelerating that through the transactional component. So I would tell you from 90 days ago, we actually executed better in the software space.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now on the flip side, our hardware base of business, which carries tremendous value from a platform perspective. As you all know, we are in the back end of our mainframe cycle. We're eight quarters in to arguably one of the most successful mainframe programs that we've had to-date and that's driven by the differentiated value proposition and our ability to continue building out and enduring platform. 90 days ago, compared to where we ended up today, we fell a little short on our Systems hardware and where we're at.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now, as you heard in the prepared remarks, we have invested and you've seen in our development expense, overall in the first half, which has been up. We had been investing in driving the teams very hard, because as we all know, the Systems segment follows innovation cycles. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we are going to come out with new innovation on our high-end mainframe and our high-end storage later in 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Wamsi Mohan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in again. Apologies, I guess, I might have been routed through Huawei network before. Jim, can you talk a little bit about the overall enterprise demand environment as you look into the back half of the year, there are a lot of macro issues around trade, Brexit, China. Just wondering what you're seeing through a broader macro lens.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And more specifically, some of the workforce rebalancing was targeted towards Cloud &amp; Cognitive. Obviously, you've demonstrated some really strong growth over there in the quarter. So curious, what specifically you're doing in that segment around the workforce rebalancing? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay, Wamsi, I'm glad you got back in. Thank you. Obviously, all of us, we operate in 170 countries around the world. We are constantly monitoring information around market dynamics and in particular around the client buying behavior, which I think is at the core of your question.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now, we would tell you, the IT industry is still growing in excess of GDP. And in particular, as you see play out in our results, around key high-value areas data and AI, cloud, security, digital where there's tremendous value proposition to allow our clients to differentiate their competitive positioning as they move along their digital reinvention journeys to the cloud and journey to cognitive enterprise and we see that continuing to play out.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Now, with that said, the IT industry is always been predicated in my mind on effective balance between leveraging technology for growth and leveraging technology for productivity, and at certain times, things change and that balance changes.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I would tell you today what we're seeing on client buying behaviors is a slight shift more and more to productivity, to quick payback ROI. And more importantly, as the CFO, I could tell you directly in uncertain times, you want predictability. And our value equations really played to that especially in our software part of our portfolio and our services.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">But I would tell you, when you look across the world, we had pretty good growth around both major markets and around components of emerging markets. U.K. Canada, Japan, Spain grew very nicely and consistently. And from an industry perspective, we're seeing pretty good pervasive growth still in insurance, in financial markets, in health care, life sciences, education, on travel transportation, but we see pretty good perspective overall.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Patricia Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks. Ted, can we please take one last question?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. The last question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">David Grossman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. Jim maybe you can just touch on free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. I think in your prepared remarks, you've mentioned a couple of items. One was the gain on sale of the software assets. The other was the real estate gain. Are there any other known headwinds or tailwinds that we should keep in mind that may impact the comparison next year excluding obviously any impact from Red Hat?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jim Kavanaugh</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Thank you, David. I appreciate the question, because free cash flow is obviously front and center right now with all of us around continuing to shift this business model to higher value.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We're very excited about the Red Hat acquisition. We do think it's a game-changer where we're going with regards to helping our clients in Chapter 2 and we're also prudently driving the financial discipline and manage it -- management in this company around delevering the company and around getting back to our targeted leverage ratios within a couple of years.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But if you take a look at free cash flow, first of all, we're very pleased in the first half. We delivered over $4 billion of free cash flow in the first half. That's up $900 million driven by continued working capital efficiency, offset by operating profit here in the first half, but we got very good, sound capital management. And we talked about a couple of those components in the prepared remarks as you called out.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Now, with the Red Hat acquisition, we're going to talk much more about this on August 2nd and put it in perspective of why we're better between IBM and Red Hat together and share with our investors our business profile, our synergies, our capabilities, our financial model and the investment thesis going forward. So, we look forward to talking to all of you in about 10 days from now plus or minus as we move forward. And we'll give some discussion about guidance on free cash flow as we forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So with that said, I just want to make a few comments to wrap up the call. Our performance this quarter, I think is a great basis from, which to move forward in the future. We set the foundation and now one that includes Red Hat effective July 8th. On August 2nd, as I just said in the last question we're going to host our Investor webcast. We'll talk about how IBM is addressing what we call chapter two of our clients' digital reinventions.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We'll have several of our senior leaders lay out our strategy and show how IBM plus Red Hat is ideally positioned to address the opportunity ahead of us. And then I'll wrap up with our financial view of IBM and also not only talk about 2019, but more importantly, give a perspective about where this business is going in the medium-term as we move forward. So as always, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to continue the dialogue in early August.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Patricia Murphy</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks. Ted, let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. Thank you for participating on today's call.

The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With that, let me hand it over to Bob.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Bob Swan</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Mark. The second quarter was significantly stronger than we forecasted in April and our results demonstrated our customer's preference to the performance of Intel XPUs as workloads grow, diversify, and become increasingly complex. That leads for performance manifested in strong mix in ASPs across the business. Our Q2 results are proof points for the megatrends that underpin our strategy. The world's insatiable appetite for data is driving demand for solutions to process, store and move it faster and better.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Customers want to work with partners, who can deliver performance and platforms to address their most important technology challenges. Our data-centric businesses overall performed roughly in line with our April expectations. Data center and IoTG customers chose our highest-performing products leading to strong mix in ASPs. While our cloud customers absorb capacity they put in place over the last year, we continue to expect cloud demand to improve in the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Enterprise and government spending remains weak however, particularly in China. PC demand continued to improve particularly in the commercial segment. We now expect the PC TAM to be up slightly for the full year. Strong demand for our highest-performing products and the productivity and TCO gains they deliver continues.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Mix was stronger than we anticipated. While small core supply improved we were not able to fully satisfy customer demand for these SKUs in the second quarter. Tariffs and trade uncertainties created anxiety across our customers supply chain and drove a pull-in of client CPU orders into the second quarter. We also halted shipments to certain customers in response to the U.S. government's revised entity list. After a thorough review, we were able to resume shipments of some products in compliance with regulations and the net impact on the second quarter was limited.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">While we hope and expect trade issues to be resolved, further tightening of export restrictions would come with revenue risk to our business. As a result, we entered the second half of the year a little more cautious than we were 90 days ago.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We met with many of you in May at our investor meeting, where we outlined three major thrusts of our game plan to transform our company and grow. First, we're pursuing the largest opportunity in our company's history a nearly $300 billion TAM comprised not just of CPUs for PCs and servers, but of XPUs and adjacent technologies for an incredibly wide range of workloads and devices. Second, we're strengthening our product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. And third, we're evolving our culture and improving our execution so that we can play an even greater role in our customer's growth and success.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I'll take a few minutes to share some of the progress we're making. I'll start with expanding our opportunity and expanding our TAM. Over the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our served market, while the PC market was declining. Our served market now is more than five times larger and growing faster and we have reallocated spending to expand our capabilities in higher growth areas.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We are evolving Intel Inside from a CPU inside a PC to XPUs inside everything that processes stores and moves data. Big bets in 5G, AI and autonomous systems are an important part of this transformation. In May, I outlined a disciplined framework for investing in and evaluating big bets as we expand into new markets. First, we'll invest where we have an opportunity to lead major technology inflection.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Second, our investments should allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. And finally, they must show a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Network infrastructure, which is transforming as the industry transitions to 5G, is one of our most important areas of investment and we are laser-focused on this opportunity. This business is growing at a 40% CAGR since 2014 from just over $1 billion in revenue to more than $4 billion last year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The network cloudification that comes with 5G expands our opportunity in the core network and at the edge, as more data moves closer to where it is created. We expect to be in production on Snow Ridge, Intel's 10-nanometer system-on-chip technology for 5G base stations early next year. We've already announced that two large telecom equipment manufacturers have committed to this architecture and we're on track to 40% share in this market segments by 2022.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">While the 5G network opportunity meets each of our investment criteria, the 5G smartphone opportunity does not. This is why we decided to exit the 5G smartphone modem business and conduct an analysis of our options for the remaining parts of that portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Today, we announced the sale of the majority of our 5G smartphone modem business to Apple. This deal preserves Intel's access to critical IP we have developed. It enables us to focus on the more profitable 5G network opportunity where we are growing and winning share. Another growth market we're gaining share is the Internet of Things. We are using our architecture accelerators and software assets, combined with unmatched scale and partners to develop one of the industry's fastest-growing IoT portfolios.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Taken together, the IoTG and Mobileye businesses grew at 22% over last year after adjusting for the sale of Wind River. More intelligence is moving to the edge and more industries want to harness the power of data to create business value innovate and grow. Devices and systems are becoming more autonomous. This is a trend IoTG is shaping and capitalizing on. Our team's work is producing outstanding results.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the second quarter, we grew at roughly 3x the market rate and are positioned to significantly outgrow the market over time. Here again, we saw demand for performance and strength across all verticals we served with computer vision being an especially critical workload. Mobileye is positioned to lead another huge opportunity, autonomous driving. This business has grown at more than 30% CAGR since we acquired them in 2017.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our market leadership continues to build momentum with 20 new design wins this year, representing 11 million lifetime units. Nissan's ProPILOT 2.0 and NIO's pilot vehicles have begun production featuring Mobileye base L2+ system for hands-free assisted driving technology. I visited the Mobileye team in Israel last month and was treated to an autonomous ride through the streets of Jerusalem. The progress we are making in Level four and Level five autonomy is extraordinary. Our mobility as a service JV with VW for deploying a commercial robotaxi service in Tel Aviv by 2022 is on track.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Global coverage of REM or Road Experience Management mobilized real-time crowdsourced mapping capability is expanding rapidly. Several major auto OEMs, most recently Ford, are adopting this breakthrough data-centric capability.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">To understand the power of this data consider this; 1.5 million kilometers is sent to the cloud daily for BMW production vehicles. With the data collected from just the last four weeks, Mobileye was able to automatically map 94% of the German Autobahn and motorway network.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And the commercial opportunity for REM extends beyond real-time maps for vehicles. Since announcing the agreement earlier this year, Mobileye and Ordnance Survey have jointly launched a service that delivers high-precision road network location data to companies across multiple sectors.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Artificial intelligence is a $10 billion data center silicon opportunity by 2023. And today it's fueling cloud customer demand for solutions that accelerate demand in AI workloads. This is evidenced by the fact that key cloud customers, most recently Baidu, are collaborating on our Nervana Neural Network Processor for Training or NNP-T.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">NNP-T will sample to customers later this year expanding our already diverse AI portfolio which spans multiple architectures including ASICs like NNPI, TPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, all unified by single programming model, One API.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The second major element of our game plan is extending product leadership by accelerating the rate of innovation. The future of computing will require a solution-oriented mindset building on six pillars of innovation.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Over the last 50 years, Intel has delivered breakthrough-after-breakthrough in computing performance that has propelled technology and society forward. We are far from finished as our product and customer announcements over the last quarter demonstrate.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our Data Center Group just announced a very important strategic partnership with SAP to optimize Intel's platforms including Xeon Scalable processors and Optane DC persistent memory for SAP's end-to-end enterprise software applications including SAP S/4HANA.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For over a decade, we have worked closely with SAP and developing differentiated breakthrough technologies that make organizations run more efficiently. The broadening of our strategic partnership with SAP will allow our mutual customers to accelerate the organization's digital transformation by deploying SAP business applications optimized for Intel-based infrastructure in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid environments.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our ecosystem partners have already received Icelake server samples. We are making good progress on Icelake server and are now planning to start production wafers in the first half of 2020 with the volume ramp in the second half of the year. Both yield and defect density are ahead of schedule for our 10-nanometer data center products.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Cascade Lake, which is ramping now, is on track to be one of our fastest ramping products ever and we have a great solution for our customers in the first half of 2020 with Cooper Lake in the same platform as Icelake.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We are working more deeply with our customers to understand their needs and become the partner that they rely on to innovate and grow their businesses. They challenge us. It's producing results and it's making us better.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">For example in the second quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Google to collaborate on Anthos, a new reference design based on the second-generation Xeon Scalable processor and an optimized Kubernetes software stack that will deliver increased workload portability to customers who want to take advantage of hybrid cloud environments.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">These deep customer engagements are frankly one of my favorite parts of the role. We are constantly thinking about how we can help our data center customers harness the potential of data by processing, storing, and moving it more efficiently. And a central part of the equation is interconnect technology, which is why we recently announced our intention to acquire Barefoot Networks. Barefoot Networks is an emerging leader in Ethernet switch silicon software with the programmability and flexibility necessary to meet the performance needs of the hyperscale cloud. We closed the transaction this week and we are excited to have the Barefoot team as part of the Intel family.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our client computing customers can look forward to exciting new Intel products this year. In the second quarter, we launched a special edition of the world's best gaming processor the Core i9-9900KS. We also launched our new 10th Gen Core product family codenamed Ice Lake which integrates Wi-Fi 6, Gen11 graphics and AI acceleration. While we are delivering on the present we are also creating the future.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Intel Labs is researching completely new architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing that promise incredible leaps in performance and power efficiency. Neuromorphic computing strives to emulate the neural structure and operation of the human brain, which could deliver big advancements in artificial intelligence by allowing computers to sense, learn and behave more naturally and efficiently.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Just this month, we announced an eight million neuron neuromorphic system comprising 64 Intel Loihi research chips that's now available to the broader research community. Finally, we are evolving our culture and improving execution because our customers are counting on us.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our process technology road map continues to improve and we're making excellent progress on 10-nanometer. We began shipping Ice Lake clients in the second quarter supporting systems on the shelf for the holiday selling season and expect to ship Agilex, our first 10-nanometer FPGA later this year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We now have two factories in full production on 10-nanometer. We are also on track to launch 7-nanometer in 2021. With a roughly 2x improvement in density over 10-nanometer, our 7-nanometer process, which will be comparable to competitors' 5-nanometer nodes, and will put us on pace with historical Moore's Law scaling.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We're also making steady progress increasing CPU supply. Through our investments, focused execution and tighter customer collaboration, we expect our PC CPU supply will be up mid single-digits this year, while we expect the PC TAM to grow slightly. We'll continue to work with our customers to meet their required product mix and ramp additional capacity to ensure we are not a constraint on their growth.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">A final point of pride in the second quarter that speaks to Intel's values is the release of our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights the progress made over the last year toward our 2020 goals around environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion and social impact.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We achieved a number of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule: energy conservation, non-hazardous waste recycling, workforce diversity and technology empowerment. Being responsible stewards of the communities in which we operate is central to our culture and it is helping us transform and deliver the results you expect of us. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished over the last quarter and look forward to sharing more proof points of our progress with you in the coming months.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">With that, I'll hand off to George, who will take you through the financial details.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>George Davis</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. We had a solid Q2 with revenue coming in at $16.5 billion, down 3% year-on-year and higher by $900 million compared to our guide. Data-centric revenue was $7.7 billion, down 7%. And PC-centric revenue was $8.8 billion, up 1% year-on-year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our Q2 operating margin was 31%, down two points as client ASP strength was more than offset by platform volume declines and continued NAND pricing degradation. Q2 earnings per share came in at $1.06, up 2% year-on-year and $0.17 over our guide for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated $5.7 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.4 billion to shareholders, paid dividends of $2.8 billion, and repurchased approximately 117 million shares.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As mentioned last quarter, we anticipated a more challenging year in 2019 coming off a large build-out of capacity in 2018 by DCG customers as well as the pricing dynamics in memory, which is largely playing out as expected. In light of these factors I'm pleased with our results and operating performance for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Non-GAAP EPS was up 2% year-over-year driven by strength in our platform ASPs, lower 10-nanometer startup costs, lower operating expenses, as well as lower shares outstanding and a McAfee dividend.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Offsetting factors were data centric demand softness, continued NAND pricing pressure and PC supply constraints, impacting our ability to fulfill low-end PC demand. Our non-GAAP tax rate came in at around 12% in line with last year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's now turn to segment performance. Our Data Center Group ended the quarter with revenue at $5 billion, down 10% from the prior year and up 2% sequentially. This was slightly ahead of our expectations with platform ASPs, up 2% year-on-year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Xeon ASPs were up double digits year-on-year on mix as our customers continue to select high-performance products. Against the tough year-over-year compare platform units were down 12%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Cloud revenue was down 1% year-over-year as cloud service providers absorbed capacity after growing demand 40% in 2018. Enterprise and government revenue declined by 31% with particular weakness in China while communication service provider's revenue increased 3% year-over-year. We see comms service provider demand still in the early phase of a meaningful 5G-related build-out.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Overall, our other data-centric businesses were down 1% year-over-year or up 2% excluding Wind River on strength in our Internet of Things businesses, partially offset by ASP weakness in our memory business.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our Internet of Things businesses, which include IOTG and Mobileye continue to show growth and delivered record revenue, up 22% excluding Wind River. IOTG showed strength across all segments with revenue growth of 23% year-over-year excluding Wind River and operating income growth of 21% on strong demand for higher-performance products in the quarter. We believe a portion of the revenue outperformance in IOTG is from tariff-related pull-ins.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our Mobileye revenue and operating margin were up year-over-year 16% and 20%, respectively on continued ADAS penetration. Our memory business revenue was down 13% as the industry supply surplus continue to feed a deteriorating NAND pricing environment.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">NSG operating income weakened by approximately $220 million year-over-year. PSG revenue declined 5% year-over-year as softness in cloud and enterprise demand more than offset growth in 5G wireless. Advanced products, which includes those manufactured on 28-nanometer through 14-nanometer process nodes grew 15% year-on-year. PSG operating margin was down 49% year-over-year on lower revenue, product mix and 10-nanometer road map investments.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The Client Computing Group demonstrated strong execution this quarter with revenue up 1% year-over-year on mix driven ASP strength, strong demand in commercial PCs and modems and $200 million to $300 million in revenue from order pull-ins due to trade and tariff concerns.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We believe the PC TAM grew slightly in Q2, led by our commercial PC demand. Our PC units were down 5% as our small core supply was constrained and we cannot fulfill all of our customer demand. We have made significant progress against our supply challenges and we expect supply and demand to return to balance in the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">That said, demand has been stronger than expected and product mix will continue to be a challenge in the third quarter as our teams work to align available supply with demand.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We saw strong ASPs in the quarter with notebook ASPs, up 3% year-over-year and desktop ASPs, up 5%. Operating margin for our client group was 42%, up five points year-on-year on strong revenue and mix and lower cost of sales post qualification of our 10-nanometer Icelake client product.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">For the first two quarters, we generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow. And we invested $6.9 billion in capital to ramp 10-nanometer capacity and for 7-nanometer product development.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We also spent $5.6 billion to repurchase 117 million shares to date. Buyback was accelerated in the second quarter, where our average purchase price was $46.78 per share. We have $11.7 billion remaining on our Board authorization.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now let's talk about the full year outlook. For the full year, the market dynamics reflected in our April guide remain largely in place, although, memory has continued to weaken relative to our expectations.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Although we have seen a weaker first half in our data center business, we expect a better second half as demand from cloud and comms service providers, improves and our second Gen, Xeon Scalable continues to ramp.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We are increasing our revenue outlook for the full year by $500 million to $69.5 billion to reflect the out performance in the second quarter, somewhat offset by the effect of trade-related pull-ins and a weaker memory environment.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We continue to expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be down low single digits for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our guidance for full year PC-centric business growth, remains a low single-digit decline for the year, reflecting share loss in small core applications, where we have been short supply longer than expected and demand has remained healthy.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We expect to have additional small core forward supply in the second half which should allow us to regain some of that lost share. Operating margin for the year is expected to be 32% flat to our previous guide. Full year expectations for gross margin are unchanged at approximately 60%.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We expect Q3 gross margins to be roughly line with Q2, on strong flow-through of higher revenue offset by increased 10-nanometer cost as we ramp production. The cost increase in Q3 will be tempered, as we will be selling through some of the previously reserved 10-nanometer in the quarter. And we see the benefit of a grant related to our NAND factory in China.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We expect Q4 gross margin to be down 3 points to 3.5 points sequentially, as we continue to ramp 10-nanometer. And will have sold through the previously reserved inventory. And will also not see the benefits of the NAND grant.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We are making great progress on 10-nanometer. And expect to see continued yield improvement as we move into 2020. And work through the cost curve. Full year spending is expected to be down almost $1 billion year-on-year, in line with our prior outlook, adjusted for cost related to our acquisition of Barefoot Networks. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">We are now expecting 2019 savings from our modem exit to rise to approximately $400 million to $500 million from our earlier estimates of $200 million to $300 million. The increased savings are being offset by higher spending on 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer processes and product R&amp;D.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Earnings per share for the year, is now expected to be $4.40 up $0.05 from our April guide, reflecting higher Q2 earnings offset somewhat by the impact of tariff pull-ins on the second half, weaker memory and a slightly higher full year tax rate.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We now expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 and Q4 to be approximately 13% up slightly from our April guide as we anticipate a higher mix of lower pre-tax income in the second half and higher tax demands.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning to Q3 outlook, we expect revenue of $18 billion up 9% sequentially, which is within our normal seasonal range after adjusting for trade-related pull-ins in Q2. Our data-centric and PC-centric businesses will be down mid-single digits year-over-year in Q3 against very challenging compares.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We expect Q3 operating margin of 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.24, on higher sequential revenue particularly in PC, data center and IoT.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I will conclude here. And turn the call back to Mark.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">&lt;<mark director-="""" h.="""" henninger="""" investor="""" president-finance="""" relations="""" vice="""">&gt;</mark></p>, <p class=""p p7"">All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&amp;A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please go and introduce our first caller.</p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Certainly, our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Chris Danely</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey! Thanks guys. Just a question on share expectations, I know in the Analyst Day you expected the competitive environment to get a little more -- I guess a little more competitive, although it doesn't seem happening in Q2. And maybe you can talk about how you expect your share to trend over the next four to six quarters in light of the competitor coming out with 7-nanometer and then you guys introducing 10-nanometer later on. Do you think you'll maybe lose share over the next three to four quarters and then gain it back? Or how should we think about things are going to play out?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey, Chris, it's Bob. First, I would say that during the course of this year as George mentioned in his prepared comments, we lost a little bit of share in the second quarter, particularly in CSG at the low and small core, primarily due to supply constraints. And our expectation is that we'll begin to work our way back in the second half of the year given the capacity we put in place to have more supply and meet our customers' demand. But stepping back and just looking at the macro environment over the next several years and particularly in the second half of the year on the data center side, what we've indicated is it will be a much more competitive environment.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our intentions are with a -- not a 90% share position, but more like a 23% share position that we have significant prospects for growth across multiple aspects of our business. And our intentions are over the -- over that time frame to continue to grow our data-centric collection of businesses at or above market rates to grow. So that's consistent with what we said back in January. We reiterated it again at our May Investor Day and nothing's really changed from that standpoint. Thanks, Chris.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. So a two-part question on the Data Center Group. I guess first and foremost, could you just discuss a little bit about the differences between the sub segments? The cloud side was impressively strong in the quarter and it sounds like you think it's going to continue. But the enterprise and government side, I know you said that was China specific, but that was exceedingly weak. Any more color on what's going on and that enterprise side in the current quarter and probably of equal if not greater importance the second half looks like you still expect a really big ramp and potentially better than seasonal. What gives you the confidence in the second half ramp in DCG?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yeah. Hey, Ross, it's Bob. I'll comment and then George will pile on. First on growth overall we had -- cloud I'd still put in the relatively soft category to the first half of the year as the cloud players continue to digest. And our expectations have been and still are that cloud will get a little bit stronger as we go into the second half. And as George mentioned, comms has been low single-digits as our customers begin to build up for the transition to 5G, so we expect that growth to probably materialize more as we go into the latter part of this year, but I think more in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Enterprise and government has been brutal through the first six months of the year. Q1 was really soft. Q2 was even softer. And while we don't like it, it's been pretty much in line with how we expected the first half and even the second half of the year to kind of play out. A couple of dynamics. You'll remember last year was really strong for enterprise and government. Growth was much stronger than we expected. Our belief at the time is that that was largely a function of increased digital transformation by CIOs, a favorable tax reform environment that gave them a little more capacity to spend. And we benefited from that tremendously last year.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So the first half of this year even the second half comps -- or comps are much tougher. And I would say our sense is that CIOs broadly speaking are a little more cautious as they go into the second half of the year. And then when you just take -- that's a broad-based comment. And then when you take China into account, China is even worse than that. So our thoughts to the first half of the year and even going into the second half of the year is the E&amp;G environment won't get dramatically better. Cloud will get a little bit stronger and comms will get a little bit stronger in the context of our overall full year guide.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. I would just add that we -- again we saw enterprise and government down 31% year-over-year. I would say, maybe a little bit weaker than even we were forecasting which is for a pretty weak performance in that group. But in general, I wouldn't add any more to what Bob said.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks a lot.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So we have gross margins coming down into Q4, you're probably in the low to mid-58%. And I know at the Analyst Day, you sort of gave an indication for gross margins in like the 2021 time frame to be around 57% on a $77 billion number. I guess how do I think about the trajectory from where we're exiting this year to the gross margin profile in 2021? Does that imply that 2020 gross margins should be down from obviously 2019, and 2021 should be down from 2020? And then what happens if you actually don't hit your revenue guidance of $77 billion in 2021, because the margins impact is mostly fixed? Does that imply margins come down even more in that case?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I think -- hey, Stacy. It's George. We did say that we think we'll bottom out at 57% in 2021. We didn't guide specifically for 2020, but implied it would be closer to the 60% range. And I would say, one of the things that's going to help us -- two things that are probably going to help us as we think about 2019 to 2020. One is we're going to see more of the benefit of moving up the yield curve in 10-nanometer, which is pretty painful now and you're seeing that really in the fourth quarter gross margin. I would also say, though you're seeing a really pure impact of memory in the fourth quarter as well, because we have a grant in the third quarter. So, you're going to see a sequential step down just because of the absence of the grant, and it just tells you how much the impact on gross margin overall for the DC-centric group has been because of memory.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I think memory, if we can start to see improvement on that in 2020, and there's some evidence of firming of the ASPs, but probably too early to call that. I think that could also be a factor. But you're also seeing growth in our adjacent businesses, which have attractive margins. They'll continue to grow into 2020. And like I said, I think largely it's going to be 10-nanometer yield curve benefits, maybe a little bit improving memory and then improving adjacent businesses should be a little more positive than what we're seeing purely in Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, thanks. I had a question for George. So George, I'm just trying to figure out the incremental accretion from the sale of the modem business. It doesn't seem like a lot of it’s dropping through to op margin, because you're investing more in 7 and 10-nanometer. So I'm just wondering why that would be the case if yields are on track. Thanks, George.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Well, one of the things that we talked about Tim was trying to pull in as much as possible both the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer road map, because we think the economics of that is more than worth the investment. And really the investments we're making now are all focused on executing for that. We're going to see more accretion from this deal coming in the following year when we would expect a significant increase in the reduction, and sort of the run rate OpEx for the piece that's going out at the end of the year. So maybe $400 million to $500 million this year, but you can probably double that number for next year, which we think will help on the total spending.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And the question is will we need to retain this higher level run rate that we're seeing today for acceleration fully into next year? I think there might be some opportunity there as well. But we're going to -- we're going to invest first in those things that we think drive yield improvement in 10 and product performance improvement in 10 and 7.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank You. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just again to kind of step back from the data-centric businesses. On the revised full year outlook, you're still guiding data-centric to be down low single-digits year-over-year. Previously within data-centric you guys were looking for DCG specifically to be down mid-single digits year-over-year which implies about 20% growth in DCG second half versus first half. Is that still how the team sees DCG for the full year?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">I would say we're still roughly in that ballpark. We haven't really changed our view of the full year to maybe a little bit that slipped into the first half relative to our original second half expectations on the pull-ins even though it's more of an impact on the PC side that we saw a little bit of that in DCG. So now we're looking to a strong second half for DCG.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks for taking my question. On inventory they were up about 12% sequentially in terms of dollars. And now when I look at your second half sales, you're forecasting them to grow 13% to 14% half over half so it kind of makes sense. But just inventory in terms of historical levels they're still quite elevated given the macro conditions. So is this all 10-nanometer-related inventory? Just what's driving this? How do you see it trending in the second half? And will there be any impact on the gross margins from any utilization changes that might be needed?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure. Great question. And we're watching inventory very closely ourselves. The big bounce this quarter as you suspected was really about 10-nanometer within finished goods coming onto the balance sheet. And so there is actually some gross margin benefit which we began to see this quarter and we'll see a little bit next quarter previously reserved inventory then flowing into the marketplace so some gross margin benefit from that and you've seen that in the CCG margins.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We -- yes, normally we'll be up going into the seasonally strong third and fourth quarters in this quarter. I would say overall that we think the -- add this quarter which are all related to 10-nanometer make sense. I think we feel still that our inventory is higher than we would like in memory and we will look to bring that down over time. It's a very tough market to bring it down and then feel good about yourself. So we'll continue to watch that. But that's been part of the pressure on free cash flow has been some of these working capital particularly inventory impacts.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>A – Bob Swan</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">To George's point the -- while we're not big fans of growing inventory we feel great about qualifying the Icelake product in the second quarter. And that qualification is the single biggest reason for the step function and inventory from Q1 to Q2. So we knew if we executed on our plans of the Icelake clients qualifications we'd have a step-function inventory and we feel good about getting that qualification done and behind us. The implications of that is the higher balance in Q2 versus Q1.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">John Pitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Maybe if I can go back to the gross margin from -- at the Q4 level, I'm just kind of curious given that CapEx has been running significantly ahead of depreciation I'm kind of curious if there's anything going on the depreciation schedule which is impacting the calendar fourth quarter gross margins.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And George to the extent in the previous question, you talked about maybe some tailwinds relative to the fourth quarter run rate next year in 2020 how do we think about the bridge from sort of the Q4 guide of kind of 58.5 to the Analyst Day guide for 2021 of 57. Is that all just the impact of 7-nanometer coming on in that year? Or is there some price consideration? How should we conceptually think about that?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay, John. That's a great three-part question. There's nothing unusual going on in depreciation in the fourth quarter. As I said most of the impact is really related to -- we'll have gotten through all of the previously reserved 10-nanometer products. So you're going to see more pressure on gross margin from the products that are coming into the marketplace while we're still at the low end of the yield curve on 10-nanometer, which is where we are today.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">In 2020, how I think about 2020, I think, we -- as I said earlier we think we'll see a benefit from moving up the yield curve on 10-nanometer. We're pleased with our process work that's going on there now. And also we would expect that memory which has been a significant drag on gross margin this year will help us a little bit overall. So, no real change. Probably the easiest thing would have just to go back and say no real change in our outlook that we gave at Analyst Day in terms of the gross margin trajectory over the next few years.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hey, George, the only thing I would add on the depreciation is, there's nothing kind of out of the norm. There are two fairly big dynamics that happened over the course of the next several months. One is over time we had more and more of our 14-nanometer equipment that's fully depreciated. So, as you know, that's been our engine for a while, and we'll have more and more fully depreciated assets that are at work. Now, that's obviously favorable.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">On the flip side, we have -- we talked about ramping two fabs and we've had a lot of assets under construction on our balance sheet that weren't being depreciated. So, in one sense you have a drop-off from the life of 14-nanometer equipment. At the same time, you're deploying some of the 10-nanometer equipment that we bought previously.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, those two things underneath the cover at the macro level to George's point, there's not a dramatic change. But underneath the cover is just two fairly big dynamics in the makeup of our equipment base and what's fully depreciated versus what's being put into service.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Joe Moore</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Great. Thank you. You talked about the reasons for being a little more conservative about the second half than you felt 90 days ago, but your second half guidance isn't materially different than it was 90 days ago. So, I guess, how are you thinking that relative to the forecast?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I guess when you talk about pull-ins like what is that -- I'm surprised that there is pull-ins at the same that there's shortages. So, maybe you can just describe what the behavior is that's pulling revenue into Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. So, again, for the second half -- really for the full year, we're largely seeing the full year as we talked about it 90 days ago.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">What I think the biggest difference is just how strong PC demand has been and the pull-ins that came into the second quarter leading to a much stronger second quarter where we are passing obviously some of that through with the exception of the pull-ins to the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, I don't want to sound like we're going to -- we'll see the normal seasonal balance and will be a strong second half of the year for the company. And I think, we're expecting a strong DCG improvement in the second half as they get through the capacity digestion. We think the PC is going to continue to be quite strong. So, relative to our forecast, I guess, I may be countering a little bit this idea of a weaker second half. Other than memory has been a little bit weaker than we had expected. ASPs are certainly down more, and so we're anticipating some pain from that. And then, of course, some level of demand was pulled into the second quarter, but it's really reflective of the year that is playing out largely as we expected with some upside on PC TAM.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. And I think the only thing that I would add to that is relative to where we were in April, looking out the second half of the year, we still have the threat of tariffs going up for goods coming out of China and the implication to that. And there's still a little bit of -- a little lack of clarity about the implications of the entity list and how quickly applications for licenses will be received and processed. So, I think that the real -- we're kind of $900 million better in the quarter. It took the year off for $500 million. We attributed roughly $400 million to pull-ins.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As we go into the second half, we're just the -- there's still a little bit unknown about what -- how this China thing is going to play out. And that's a big important market for us and that's probably what makes me a little more anxious.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. George and maybe Bob as well, we've heard and continue to hear rumblings of -- and you guys have addressed this at the Analyst Day and in other forums about how you might be price aggressive in certain sectors to try to protect market share. And I wonder if you might comment about how you're thinking about that strategically in your notebook business where you have 10-nanometer product coming online versus in your desktop business where you might be on 14-nanometer for a bit longer. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bob Swan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. First, I'd start with at the risk of repeating myself a TAM of $300 billion, the largest TAM in the company's history with a pretty decent wind at our back in terms of this insatiable appetite for data and what it means for the products that we build and design. So we view ourselves as having a relatively low-share position with significant opportunity to grow. But at the same time, we know it's just -- we're not the only ones that have seen a data-centric world. That will be a more intensely competitive environment. And our expectations over time are to protect our market share position, while continuing to invest in new prospects for growth. And that hasn't really changed.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">When you look at that by segment, we're going to be -- on the PC side, we've been protecting our position for the last couple of years. I'd say the competitive intensity on the PC side started probably in the first part of 2017. And during that time frame, we've either protect our position, while moving end customers up to higher performance products that generate higher ASPs and with that have the capacity also to fight back and meet comps in targeted areas, where we need to.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, that's how we think about this big opportunity to grow large market, protect our position while expanding into new vectors, and that transforms all segments and we're a little more protective about some segments versus others in those cases particularly when we're in a supply-constrained environment. So, not a whole lot has really changed on that other than we know it's going to be more competitive, and we try to take that into account as we thought about not only our second half outlook, but our three-year outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Henninger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Matt. And operator, I think we have time for just one more question and then we’ll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">David Wong</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks very much. Just a clarification of what you had said with regard to restrictions in shipments to various entities in China. Can you say that the net result was actually small in the second quarter? And will there be -- do you expect any meaningful impact on DCG revenues from restrictions and shipments in the third quarter? Or is that going to be small too?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">George Davis </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Again, it was more in the second quarter. In fact, it was probably a net positive, because of pull-in activities. So if you look at what we were prohibited from shipping versus what was pulled in on things we're allowed to ship, where people were concerned that perhaps restrictions would become greater that was a net positive in the second quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We think that dynamic just remains in play in the second half of the year. How much of the demand concerns were met in the second quarter, we'll have to see how that plays out, but our forecast is based on kind of the current state of activity. And as Bob said, we're -- it doesn't mean that we're not concerned or cautious about what could happen if there's a change in policy between now and the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Henninger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks David. And we'll hand the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Bob Swan</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Mark, and Thanks everybody for joining us. I'd just kind of close where I started. We had a -- the quarter played out much stronger than we expected. Revenue better, gross margin's better, spending in line, earning's greater. And therefore from that confidence, we're raising our full year outlook and kind of feel good about our performance six months through the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Secondly, and just more importantly, we continue to really work the supply chain, so we're never in a position to constrain our customers' growth. We've made good progress through the first half. But I think more as we go into the second half, we're just in a better position than we've been in a while. We still have work to do. We're still working with our customers, but we feel pretty good on the supply as we enter the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then third, our progress on both 10-nanometer and our confidence in migrating from 10 to seven continues to grow based on execution. So, we kind of gave you a three-year outlook. We consider this the second deposit of that 12 deposit three-year outlook and I'd say we feel pretty good about where we are. And we look forward to giving you another update 90 days from now about continued progress and momentum on our multiyear journey.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, thanks for joining us and we look forward to talking to you again in 90 days.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Mark Henninger</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks, Bob, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, can you please go ahead and wrap up the call?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Certainly. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.</p>]"

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Johnson &amp; Johnson. I'm pleased to discuss with you our solid results for the second quarter, and how our performance during the first half of 2019 positions us well for the rest of the year and beyond. During the quarter, we continued to deliver growth across the three segments of our broad-based business, while also optimizing our portfolio and making progress against long-term strategies. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Revenue and earnings per share were in line with our expectations. As expected, we did experience sales deceleration from the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of generic and biosimilar competition in our Pharmaceutical business. Income in the first half of 2019 provides us the opportunity to continue investing to fortify, accelerate and potentially add to our pipelines across all three segments. We are committed to driving solid financial and operational performance for our shareholders, while also delivering on our responsibilities to patients, employees and communities as outlined in Our Credo. Chris will provide additional franchise and product detail, but let me provide some high level framing. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our Pharmaceutical business continues to deliver strong growth across our oncology, pulmonary hypertension and immunology portfolios. We are particularly pleased with the success of DARZALEX, STELARA, IMBRUVICA and the INVEGA portfolio. As highlighted during our May pharmaceutical business review, our performance demonstrates our ability to consistently obtain approval from new products and line extensions. Once again, our performance was driven by volume of transformational medicines that address high unmet medical need rather than price. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">In our Consumer segment, we accelerated growth in the second quarter in our stronghold beauty lines of NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. We are also pleased with the contributions from newly acquired businesses DR. CI:LABO and ZARBEE's. This growth more than offset the one-time impacts related to seasonality and inventory levels we mentioned during our first quarter call. We expect to deliver competitive growth relative to the market for the year. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">In our Medical Devices segment, we did incur some isolated supply disruptions in the quarter, which Chris will outline and the impact limited growth by 1 point. Accounting for that, we grew about 4% in line with last quarter, and we are on track towards our goal of exceeding last year's performance. We continue to enhance our leadership positions in platforms such as electrophysiology, energy and endocutters. Orthopedics grew modestly during the quarter in line with Q1 led by hips and trauma. That being said, we remain intent on improving our performance in orthopedics and the segment at large. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to earnings, earnings per share was favorably impacted by a significant gain recorded in other income. Specifically, the approximately $2 billion pretax gain related to the sale of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. We closed this transaction in early April. And as mentioned during the first quarter call, this gain comprises a large majority of our other income guidance for the full year 2019. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Other income for 2019 is on par with levels experienced in 2015. And consistent with past practice, we intend to utilize these gains to invest in opportunities that increase shareholder value and better position the business for long-term success. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">I will now turn the call back to Chris to discuss second quarter sales drivers as well as highlight notable line items in our P&amp;L before I return with some comments regarding our cash position, capital allocation priorities and guidance. </p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Chris DelOrefice</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thank you, Joe. Worldwide sales were $20.6 billion for the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 1.3% versus the second quarter of 2018. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 1.6% as currency had a negative impact of 2.9 points. In the U.S. sales decreased 2.2%. In regions outside the U.S. our reported growth declined by 0.3%. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 5.5% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.8 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.7% worldwide, flat in the U.S. and 7.6% outside the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.08 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.45 a year ago. Excluding the after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.58, representing increases of 21.5% and 22.9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2018. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 25.2%. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Beginning with Consumer, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the second quarter highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2018, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.5 billion growing at 4.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.3%, with strong growth in the U.S. of 4.4% due primarily to strong performance in our beauty franchise. Growth outside the U.S. was 0.7%. Consumer continues to grow its share in the e-commerce channel. Outpacing category growth rates in that channel with strong double-digit growth across all regions. The beauty franchise grew 10.7% or about 5% adjusted to exclude the impact of the acquisition of DR. CI:LABO and the NIZORAL and ROC divestitures. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our priority brands NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance results due to share growth combined with strong sales in our club and e-commerce channels in the U.S. Share growth in NEUTROGENA was realized in the facial moisturizing treatment and sun protection categories. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">AVEENO was further aided by retail stocking for the hair products launch, OGX and MAUI MOISTURE brands continued to experience solid growth, really resulting from new market expansions. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Over-the-counter medicines grew 2.8% globally, or 1% when adjusted to exclude the impact of ZARBEE's acquisition, which continues to perform well. In the U.S., OTC adjusted operational sales growth was just over 2% and is growing share. However, the U.S. was negatively impacted by retail inventory factors. ZYRTEC was a core contributor of sales growth and grew market share. Additionally, children's MOTRIN and TYLENOL in pediatric analgesics delivered strong sales and share growth. Adult TYLENOL also continues to drive significant share growth with consumption well outpacing the category, realizing double-digit consumption growth driven by rapid release gel, and TYLENOL arthritis products. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">However, TYLENOL sales declined slightly this quarter, as its consumption was more than offset by the lapping of the supply disruption associated with Hurricane Maria and the sell-through of 2018 elevated retail inventory levels that occurred in response to seasonal and other retailer stocking dynamics.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Concluding on Consumer segment, Baby Care grew 2.2% globally. Growth was primarily due to lapping retail destocking and other events associated with the Johnson's Baby relaunch in the U.S. The Johnson's relaunch is stabilizing performance in all markets where it has been relaunched. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $10.5 billion grew 4.4% enabled by double-digit growth in nine key products. Sales were aided by one-time favorable pricing adjustments outside the U.S. worth almost 100 basis points worldwide, primarily driven by DARZALEX. Sales declined in the U.S. by 2% and increased outside the U.S. by 12.9%. Generic competition for ZYTIGA negatively impacted our worldwide and U.S. growth by about 300 basis points and 500 basis points respectively. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver global growth at competitive levels despite significant biosimilar and generic headwinds. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our oncology therapeutic area delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.1%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing about 57% globally, or about 41% when removing the impact of a favorable one-time adjustment related to the completion of pricing and reimbursement discussions in certain European countries. The U.S. grew 24% and continues to benefit from strong market growth, and about a 3 point increase in U.S. market share across all lines of therapy. The continued strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. is driven by increased penetration and share gains across the 40 EMEA countries where it is commercially available, as well as Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. Of note, just last week, we filed a regulatory submission for the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX for multiple myeloma in the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">IMBRUVICA grew over 39% globally driven largely by market share gains and strong market growth across multiple indications in the U.S. along with strong uptake outside of the U.S. and the European and Asia Pacific markets. In the U.S., based on first quarter data across all indications and lines of therapy, IMBRUVICA gained approximately 3 points of market share, and continues to be the new patient and total patient share leader in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which gained almost 8 points of market share in line one therapy. Worldwide ZYTIGA growth declined by about 20% with declines of 59% in the U.S. driven by generic competition, which was partially offset by growth of about 25% outside the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia were driven by market growth and share gains primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial. In non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of ERLEADA, which gained 4 points of market share in U.S., with the penetration of prescribers split almost evenly among urology and oncology practices.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We are also pleased with the early launch progress in EMEA, where ERLEADA is now available in five countries. During the quarter we filed regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Further, we are pleased with the early launch progress of BALVERSA for the treatment of adults with locally or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our immunology portfolio delivered global sales growth of just under 6% driven by continued strong performance in STELARA with growth of 18%, primarily from the Crohn's disease indication. We remain very pleased with the uptake of STELARA in Crohn's disease where market share has increased by over 6 points in the U.S. compared to the second quarter of 2018. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Sales growth is partially offset by continued erosion of REMICADE of 15% due to increased discounts, and modest share loss in the U.S. to alternative mechanisms of action and biosimilars. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Lastly, TREMFYA totaled $235 million globally, and is experiencing strong demand with over 35,000 patients on therapy. TREMFYA achieved a 7.6% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S., which is up 3 points from the second quarter 2018. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">In infectious diseases, our portfolio grew 5.4% led by strong growth of SYMTUZA and JULUCA for HIV partially offset by cannibalization and increased market competition in other products. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing about 16% with higher market share, driven by increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In addition, we are pleased with the launch performances SPRAVATO for treatment resistant depression. There are more than 1,600 sites certified with the REMS program and new treatment centers are being added daily. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">In our cardiovascular, metabolism and other product portfolio, we did experience declining sales of 14.7% primarily driven by declines in XARELTO, INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. XARELTO continues to increase TRx share. However, the share uptake was offset by the increase in the legislative rate for the donut hole from 50% to 70%, along with higher Medicare and donut hole utilization resulting in an overall decline in XARELTO of 19% this quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">We've seen a positive response to XARELTO's new 2.5 milligram vascular dose for the CAD and PAD indication. And while we expect the penetration of this expanded patient population to recur over time, we are confident in the value this indication provides to patients. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio grew by 6% with strong performance in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI growing by about 15% and 19% respectively on a global basis. Both benefited from further market penetration and increased share. This growth was partially offset by TRACLEER which is negatively impacted by the recent generic entry in the U.S. as well as continued generic competition outside of the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.5 billion, declining 4.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of LifeScan and ASP, adjusted operational sales growth was 3.2% worldwide. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">As Joe mentioned, we did have some isolated supply challenges in the quarter that negatively impacted growth by about 100 basis points worldwide. Adjusting for this, Medical Devices would have delivered growth of just over 4% consistent with the first quarter and a representative of the continued progress being made to improve performance in this segment. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Interventional Solutions grew about 16% globally, led by continued strength in our electrophysiology business achieving more than 16% growth worldwide continuing its trend of double-digit growth. Growth was strong in all regions, driven by our newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Additionally, we delivered a fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth in the CERENOVUS business driven by new product innovation, including EmboTrap for the treatment of ischemic stroke as well as strong market growth. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Vision growth of 1.5% was driven by contact lenses which grew almost 3% globally led by daily disposables and astigmatism lenses in the OASYS family. Our contact lenses business remained strong with year-to-date growth of just under 5% in both the U.S. and OUS. Orthopedics growth remained consistent versus Q1 of 2019 with growth of 0.6% or 0.9% when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days. We continue to make progress to improve growth in this franchise and we remain committed to executing our innovation and commercial plans that aim to improve performance. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Hips grew 3.3%, which we expect to represent above market performance globally, driven by our leadership position in the anterior approach and continued strong demand for our primary stem ACTIS, which is now our number selling stem in the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Additionally, our KINCISE Surgical Impactor designed to replace the handheld mallet is enabling hip procedures in the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Trauma growth of 1.7% globally was driven by market growth supported by strong adoption of newer innovation such as our Femoral Recon Nails. The U.S. growth rate of 3.3% is expected to be in line with the market and accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. Growth outside the U.S. was flat when adjusting for selling days and was also impacted by over 1 point due to timing of a tender shifting to the second half. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Spine declined over 2% with the U.S. being the primary driver of the decline. Our U.S. growth was flat when adjusting for acquisitions, divestitures and selling days while we continue to see some stabilization of performance driven by new products such as a VIPER PRIME System for minimally invasive surgery and EXPEDIUM VERSE our all-in-one pedicle screw system for deformity. We continue to pursue opportunities to further improve growth including new innovations such as the Symfony system we plan to launch in the second half in complex cervical.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Knees declined by less than 1% in the quarter with the U.S. being the driver of the decline. Offsetting strong growth of over 5% outside the U.S., it is expected to represent above market performance led by new innovation, including ATTUNE Revision and S+. The U.S. market is realizing positive uptake from the ATTUNE Revision System but we continue to have portfolio gaps which we are addressing to enhance performance, including the expected full commercial launch of our Cementless offering later this year. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics but was relatively stable overall compared to Q1. For the quarter U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms. Spine price pure price declined approximately 4% with hips, trauma and knees all down about 2%. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Turning to the results for the surgery business. Advanced Surgery delivered global growth of just over 6% led by strong performance in both energy and endocutters primarily driven by share gains and new products in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Biosurgery declined by over 2% due to a stopped shipment of SURGIFLO in the U.S. which impacted global biosurgery growth by 11 points. We will continue to work with the FDA to ensure this important technology for patients is available again in the U.S. market as soon as possible. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Wound closure will grew approximately 3% as conventional and barbed sutures gained share. Across total general surgery worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 250 basis points due to a field action on our Intraluminal Staplers. Corrective actions were taken in the quarter and we began distributing to customers in June. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Selling days had a minor negative impact on our global growth rates in the second quarter, and we do not expect a significant impact in any subsequent quarter in 2019. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">There’s a final comment on Medical Devices based on feedback we received from the analyst community. We will no longer be providing utilization trends during this call. These estimates were based on limited external data and provide a low correlation to our actual market performance in the segments we compete. For the final update on utilization, we did want to provide you the latest figures for Q1 since we shared estimates last quarter. Hospital admissions, surgical procedures and lab procedures all increased by approximately 1.5%, 1% and 1.5%, respectively. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">I will now provide some commentary on our earnings for the quarter. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2019 please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2019 second quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.3 billion on an after-tax basis, primarily driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.58, an increase of 22.9% versus the second quarter 2018. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.63, up 25.2% versus second quarter 2018. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings, compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly primarily driven by product mix, which was offset by improvement in selling, marketing and administrative margins for the quarter as a result of leverage in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer business. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">We continue to invest in R&amp;D at competitive levels and our investment in research and development this quarter as a percent of sales was 13%, which is higher than the second quarter 2018 by 30 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by higher investment in our Medical Devices business to support the development of our digital surgery platforms, including robotics. The increased levels of income recorded in the other income and expense line was primarily driven by the gain on the ASP divestiture. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Net interest expense was lower by $132 million, primarily driven by the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate of 20.4% was in line with the second quarter 2018 of 20.5%. We encourage you to reference our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3%, compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. The second quarter of 2019 includes the tax impact on the gain of the ASP divestiture. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now looking at adjusted income before tax. In the second quarter of 2019, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise increased from 33.7% to 41.9% in 2019, primarily driven by the gain on the divestiture of ASP. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment: </p>, <p class=""p p7"">The decrease in Pharmaceutical margins by 160 basis points was primarily driven by product mix and lower other income. Consumer margins also decreased by 480 basis points, because of lower divestiture gains that were partially offset by leveraging in selling and marketing expenses. Medical Devices increased from 27.8% to 57.5% in 2019, due to the gain on the ASP divestiture partially offset by investments in digital surgery. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">That concludes the sales and P&amp;L highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s second quarter 2019. For your reference, here's a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter. Some of which were mentioned in my comments. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">I will turn the call back to Joe. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Joe Wolk</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks, Chris. With respect to cash, at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $14 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $15 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $29 billion of debt. These levels are similar to the first quarter. We’ve simultaneously executed across all four tenants of our capital allocation strategy, which are designed and have proven historically to drive shareholder value. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Reinvestment in our business remains a top priority at Johnson &amp; Johnson. We invested $2.7 billion in research and development in the quarter, which as Chris mentioned, represents a 30 basis point increase relative to net trade sales from the second quarter of 2018. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Regarding investment in inorganic opportunities, we closed the acquisition of Auris health, and we continue to evaluate potential opportunities to further enhance our portfolio. We also used cash in the quarter to continue returning value to shareholders. As announced in April, we increased our dividend for the 57th consecutive year to $0.95 per share, distributing $2.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">We also acted on our authorized $5 billion share repurchase program in the quarter deploying $2 billion for that purpose. We are now slightly above 75% complete with the authorized program. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">I will now provide a few comments on the updates to our guidance for 2019. Our results for the first half of the year have given us additional confidence in our sales performance for the full year. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for operational sales growth by 50 basis points to a range of 1.0% to 2.0%. We are also increasing and tightening our operational sales growth adjusted for acquisitions and divestiture guidance to a range of 3.2% to 3.7%. The estimated impact of translational currency of 200 basis points has remained the same as our last update, although we are not predicting the impact of future currency movements. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Regarding adjusted pre-tax operating margin, we now expect adjusted pre-tax operating margin for the year to slightly decline, as we are planning for investment in innovation that adds to, solidifies and accelerates our pipelines. One really good example of this is our recent acquisition of Auris Health, which I just mentioned. Our opportunities to invest in digital surgery capabilities, coupled with other strategic investments in support of acquisitions, such as DR. CI:LABO are estimated to equate to about $0.10 of dilution. However, we have absorbed impacts like this in our current guidance. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">For net interest expense, we are lowering the range to between zero and $100 million due to the favorability that Chris described in his earlier remarks. We are increasing our expectations for other income, the account where we record royalty income, as well as gains and losses arising from items such as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs .We have more certainty given that we are halfway through the year and having closed the Advanced Sterilization Products transaction, we are comfortable increasing and tightening the range to approximately $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, increasing the midpoint by $200 million compared to our prior guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Regarding our effective tax rate. We are increasing our effective tax rate guidance to a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, which includes the updated impact to tax associated with the Advanced Sterilization Products divestiture gain. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance for 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">The operational EPS guidance represents strong growth of over 7% at the midpoint, which is approximately 2 times our adjusted operational sales growth, while simultaneously increasing investment levels to fortify our confidence in the long-term prospects of our business. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">We do not provide quarterly guidance. However, to better inform your modeling, I will provide a few qualitative factors to consider near-term. We expect the largest impacts from generics and biosimilars for the year in our pharmaceuticals business to occur in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by expected U.S. ZYTIGA accelerator erosion as well as the comparison to the highest growth quarter in 2018. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Also, U.S. TRACLEER and U.S. PROCRIT as well as VELCADE outside the U.S. expect accelerating erosion, driven largely by generic entries in new markets and additional competitors. Also, in the third quarter of 2018, we had the favorable impact of the U.S. baby pipeline replenishment due to the relaunch, which will not repeat. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Lastly, as I mentioned, we are taking the opportunity to incrementally invest a higher level of divestiture gains. Most notably, we plan to increase investment in our pipelines, and therefore, we would expect our R&amp;D spending to be higher in the second half of the year. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Before I hand the call back to Chris to begin the Q&amp;A, let me take a moment to thank Joaquin and Paul for being part of this call today, as well as our 135,000 global associates for their hard work and dedication. Without whom our continued success would not be possible. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Chris, let's begin the Q&amp;A portion. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Chris DelOrefice</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Joe. We will now move to the Q&amp;A portion of the webcast. As a reminder, I would encourage you to take advantage of Joaquin and Paul being on today's call by directing questions to them about their areas of expertise. Operator, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question? </p>, <p class=""p p8"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Chris Schott</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great, thanks very much for the questions. I guess my first question was just on the EPS guidance. You've steadily raised top-line growth this year. We haven't seen your earnings move that on much higher. I know you talked about some investments. But can you just elaborate a little bit more on this dynamic. So specifically, is this mostly kind of R&amp;D going into the device business or is it across your franchises? And should we think about this as a sustained higher level of investment or more of a kind of a one-time step-up this year? My second question is -- quickly was on XARELTO. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics that are resulting in this kind of sharp decline we saw in the quarter? I guess the heart of this is, are we seeing Part D dynamics that are worse than you anticipated for that franchise? Thanks so much. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey, Chris, this is Joe Wolk. Thanks for your question and good morning. With respect to EPS, I'll address that and then I'll turn it over to Joaquin to address the XARELTO question. With EPS, we are looking at the back half as investing more heavily in R&amp;D as we've consistently done for a number of years now. When we have the opportunity to divest a business where we recognize an appreciable gain, we always look to turn that back into the business whether it's for our current pipelines to fortify or solidify those, as well as to add on to our pipelines. The investment is spread I would say primarily across Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals at this point. That's the plan. If you think about what I said in some of my prepared remarks with Auris and the acquisition there, that was an additional investment that would have been dilutive of about $0.10. We've absorbed that. And so that's kind of some of the examples that I could give you. Earlier in the year, you may recall, we also did a deal with Argenx for CD70. We're going to look to continue to do things like that inorganically, as well as within our own pipeline to see what we can accelerate and bring to the market a little bit earlier for patients. Joaquin you would like to take the XARELTO question?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Thank you for the question. First, this was a strong quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with operational growth of 4.4% on very robust volume growth of 7.8% and especially very robust and strong OUS growth with 12.9%. So very positive quarter for the Pharmaceutical Group with nine products achieving double-digit growth. Specifically when you look at the underlying growth that is when you exclude U.S. ZYTIGA our growth was 7.6%. So, that is a good position for us moving into the rest of the year, and especially moving into 2020, when we anniversary the U.S. loss of exclusivity. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Moving to XARELTO. The first thing is that we continue to see XARELTO is a very important driver of growth for the Pharmaceutical Group. The decline that you see in the quarter, as was explained already, is related to higher cost for patient access due to channel mix changes particularly more sales in PHS, [BDD] [ph] and Part D and also higher statutory rebates in the donut hole. We expect that we will be able to come back to positive territory once we anniversary these factors. Where is the growth going to come from once we do that? It’s going to come first through continued volume and share growth in VTE and in AFib.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Second, we will continue to reach more patients through our CA/PAD indication, which is tracking aligned with our cardiovascular drugs, launches like ENTRESTO or BRILINTA. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">And finally, we continue our indication expansion through new indications such as VTE prevention in medically ill patients that we filed in the fourth quarter of 2018. So, overall, we continue to see XARELTO as a growth driver for the Pharmaceutical Group. We expect to be in positive territory once we anniversary those factors. And we will leverage the fact that XARELTO has the most complete set of indications, the largest safety data generating clinical trials, particularly in higher risk patients. And the most real world living experience with more than 6 million patients treated in the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Chris, thanks for the questions. I guess wanted to short build on Joe's commentary. Just as a reminder in Q1, we took our adjusted ops guidance up $0.05 that was offset by currency. And another acquisition investment I think is a good example is DR. CI:LABO as well, that we've covered the dilutive impact there. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">The next question is from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Lewis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Maybe Joe, just a quick financial one for you and then I'll focus on pharma. So just considering your commentary on spending, your other income very strong in first half of the year as expected. But as you look into 2020, that's obviously a headwind. In prior annual periods, you used SG&amp;A as a factor to offset any other income headwind. So are you comfortable as you head into next year that is supply chain reduction, some of the easing of exclusivity issues still creates an opportunity for levered earnings in 2020? </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. So, David, thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that's a great question, when we get off and with respect to the level of other income that we've had. You'll notice that today's guidance reflects pretty similar to what we experienced in 2015. And when we went into 2016, we didn't skip a beat in terms of improving our operating margins. We were able to leverage SG&amp;A as well as to have a healthier top-line. That is the outlook. We're not providing guidance, obviously for 2020 on today's call, but that is certainly the outlook and the expectation for our business moving into next year. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, maybe to parlay some of the answer for Chris' question, is this a new level or not? We've challenged the teams to look for value creating opportunities, and we're planning for higher levels of investment. Should those not materialize, obviously, we would come back and revise guidance accordingly. But right now, we think we serve patients as well as shareholders best by looking for those opportunities. When we don't have those divestitures gains, there may be a need to scale back. We also appreciate our commitment with respect to earnings expectations as well. But we will manage for the long-term. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">David Lewis </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Right Joe, very helpful. Then maybe for Joaquin I had a quick question on pharma, maybe a two part question. But many of the balance for J&amp;J has been headwinds versus some of the pipeline tailwinds. In the next quarter or so, really going to see the full effect of ZYTIGA. We've already seen effect of REMICADE. So it does feel like in the next quarter or so Joaquin, the Pharmaceutical business does -- should begin to accelerate and that acceleration should be sustained into 2020. One, is that how you see the business here in the next quarter or so? And then secondarily, can you just give us an update on where we sit with the esketamine launch in terms of [center ads] [ph] and how that launches tracking relative to the expectations? Thanks so much. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you for the question, Dave. As I said before we see a strong underlying growth in the Pharmaceutical Group of 7.6% in the second quarter as we saw also strong underlying growth in the first quarter. So as we anniversary, in particular U.S. ZYTIGA LOE, you're going to see the underlying growth coming to the forefront and that predicts for a positive 2020. The drivers of this growth are on one hand a slower ZYTIGA erosion that we had anticipated, but most importantly, what you are seeing is a nice strong performance of our core brands. As I said before, we had nine brands growing double-digit in the second quarter. So that is how we see it similar to you see it too. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">When it goes to SPRAVATO, we are working to be sure that we make it available for centers, physicians or patients as SPRAVATO was approved earlier in March. And we are excited about the therapeutic gap that is going to fill in treatment-resistant depression. We've created a model that is addressing all the areas to ensure appropriate use and distribution. We have a controlled distribution model. We have a REMS certification program and also it’s a medicine that is self-administered but under physician administration with an observation period. So far, we have already 1,600 centers that have been certified and we continue to have great interest from the psychiatry community and the patient community in this treatment alternative. So we remain very positive of all the opportunities for SPRAVATO. Overall we're very positive about the opportunities that our pipeline have and the opportunities that we will be afforded in the coming years for continuing to be reaching more patients and perhaps this maybe a real opportunity for Paul to discuss what are the opportunities that we have in the pipeline in the short run. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Paul Stoffels</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I can add something there Joaquin. We expect at the moment a pipeline of 14 medicines which can exceed to $1 billion by 2023 and reaching millions of patients. And there is a significant opportunity there to increase -- grow to new indications, increase penetration and share but also of new formulations that we have seen with DARZALEX subcu. In addition we expect 40 line extensions with more than 10 having a potential to exceed $500 million.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And at the same time going forward to your integrated, we're integrating disease areas and pathways and leveraging new technologies, cell therapy, gene therapy, data science and you will also see the first vaccines and with that continue to seek also the best signs in term of external. Our R&amp;D portfolio is not one which comes together by chance, it's very well designed the way we do as we focus on differentiated medicines and vaccines, year of life, quality of life is the first metric before the business comes, sourcing selective and agnostic early mid and late stage and then we apply excellent in-development with time, quality and differentiation as the main drivers.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And with that we have been able in the collaborative space to become a partner of choice. We have the pharma R&amp;D review you can go back to the website and have review there, the material is all still on there for all the details but let me highlight a few of the very transformational products we have in the pipeline. We have the CAR-T which we licensed from Legend in 2017 now advancing fast. We took it over start of the Phase 1 last year and now we're entering into Phase 2b and with the data generated we expect to file in the range of 2021 and the ongoing study in China continue to perform very well and that gives us lot of confidence where at the movement three years in 88% of patients achieved an overall response rate and 74% achieved a complete response. So more data will be presented by the end of the year. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">The new -- also new in our pipeline is cusatuzumab the anti-CD70 which will start earlier which we acquired from Argenx, again an investigational product for AML and that is a CD70 antibody and there we anticipate starting a Phase 2 later in the year. We also acquired three very interesting gene therapy products which represents a new platform for us in retinal disease and there the first for us is a first entry into gene therapy and positioned to be first in markets with best-in-class assets. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">And last but not least that we’ve introduced -- also a new space for us with the vaccine portfolio where we are entering with an RSV vaccine now in late stage development in older adults. But also as we announced this week, we're going to progress with an HIV vaccine which is already ongoing in Africa since two years, where we did a Phase 2b and now we start with the study in the U.S., Latin America and the Europe where we will test the HIV vaccine in high risk and MSM and transgenders. And hopefully with that, getting just a few highlights to you on the pipeline. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">We continue to build on our current pipeline with significant line extensions for expansion as well as I just was telling building on the new pipeline going for the future.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, David, appreciate the questions. Operator, next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">The next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So apologies to Paul and Joaquin, I’ve got two for Joe. So Joe, first the fundamentals of J&amp;J have been good. But the talc and opioid litigation have been overhangs for the stock. How do you move past those two issues? What are the milestones we should be looking for? And what are your messages to investors? And I have one follow-up. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure. So thanks for the question, Larry, good to speak with you. So let me take those separately. With respect to talc, as you know, and as we've said many times on this call and many other forums that we've known for decades, and it's been validated by many other agencies that are highly respected that the product is safe, we also know that the company act to responsibly, so we'll continue to pursue defense of the company's actions as well as the product going forward. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">The next major event I'd say starts in a few weeks here July 22nd to be specific, related to multi-district litigation, known as Daubert hearings, here in the State of New Jersey. That is not a ruling per se. It's a determination of evidentiary standards. So what evidence the point is, need to present what would be acceptable, and it covers about 85% of the outstanding cases. So we're obviously preparing very thoroughly for that. Again, when folks have a chance to really look at the facts in these cases, they see that the product is safe at the company act to responsibly. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">As you know, and as we've also said many times, that even when a verdict goes against us originally, we often prevail on appeal. So we'll continue to fight that one. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">With respect to the Oklahoma and the opioids litigation, a similar dynamic in that the facts simply just don't align to what the state is claiming. And so what do I mean by that? The facts specifically are is that based on Oklahoma's own Medicaid reimbursement records, not just for a period of time, but for the last 20 years, less than 1% of the reimbursement occurred for Johnson &amp; Johnson products. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">Johnson &amp; Johnson's products were designed to prevent abuse. Even the state's attorneys in this case, have said multiple times as I understand it throughout the proceedings, that this is not about Johnson &amp; Johnson's products, it's about the opioid epidemic. We agree this is an epidemic with opioid addiction. However, it's going to be multiple factorial in terms of the solution set and it's going to require many sophisticated parties to make sure that we've got the right remedies in place for people who suffer from that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Joe. And just to more quickly follow-up, just vision is being a bright spot for devices with both contact lenses and surgical growing above average, but this quarter was soft in both areas. Why was that and what turns those around? Thanks for taking the questions. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. Good observation, Larry. So I would say vision has been very strong for us. We have had for a number of years now great cadence of innovation. I think it's really turned around that business from where it was earlier this decade, our latest innovations around transition lenses, which is being very well received in the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The contact lens performance and the underlying demand continues to be strong. I would say there were some inventory adjustments that were required, we thought it was going to be more of a hard Brexit which impacted some of the first quarter levels of inventory. So we're comfortable on the contact lens side. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">On the surgical side, we're seeing a little bit softness specifically in the U.S., outside the U.S. it’s still fairly strong with some of the IOL lenses and the innovation that we introduced here about a year, year and a half ago. In the U.S., cataract and refractory are both a little bit softer from a market perspective. And we have to improve the innovation cadence there as we move into 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. Thanks, Larry. Operator, next question?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question is from Kristen Stewart with Barclays.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Kristen Stewart</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Just one for me, just on the area of digital surgery and robotics. I was wondering, if you could just provide us with an update on where you stand across the various business units in those efforts, specifically with the Verb products, what your kind of current thinking is around the opportunities with Auris and then also Orthotaxy? Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Great, thanks for the question, Kristen, nice to speak with you. So I'll start, but I'll probably turn it over to Paul as well to talk about each of the specific platforms. But maybe it's appropriate at the outset just to take a step back to provide kind of an update to our overall digital surgery strategy inclusive of the robotic enabled surgery for and endoluminal orthopedics as well as general surgery. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">So as I mentioned earlier on the call, we're very pleased with the Auris Health acquisitions, it’s off to a great start. Not only did we get some great products there and some great technology. But we secured one of the pioneers with respect to robotic surgery and Dr. Fred Moll and his team. So they're currently looking at and assessing all of our platforms. We think it's prudent of us to utilize that expertise to look at not just what we're doing for the Monarch platform in lung cancer and bronchoscope but also to take a look at Orthotaxy and as well as our partnership with Verily to see how we can make sure that it's not a matter of coming to market fast, but coming to market fast. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">And so we want to make sure that we've got a differentiated product, one that competes with the current product offerings that are out in the marketplace for the next three, five, 10 years down the road. So that's how we're approaching it. Our timelines have not changed with Orthotaxy specifically, we're still progressing towards a 2020 media regulatory submission. We feel that that's very much on track. As you know, with the acquisition of Auris, we are on the market with their Monarch platform. And we continue to make great advancements with the Verily partnership. But, Paul maybe I can turn it over to you to talk about some of the finer points on what the technology can offer?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Paul Stoffels </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you, Joe. Let me start with Auris, which as Joe said this is off to a great start with great acquisition. The Monarch platform is currently on the market for the diagnosis of lung cancer. And that is part of a broader lung cancer initiative in the company where we both look at early diagnosis as well as early intervention. And with an existing marketed platform that accelerates activity in that space very much. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">But furthermore, the possibilities of the endo -- in endourology we’re probably targeting a 90% stone free in a single treatment is within reach, as well as a very significant opportunity in GI endoscopy gives us a very strong start in the robotic space with the Monarch platform. The eye platform from Auris is a very, very attractive space which has more reach and more different positioning possible and all discovering all of the different interventions. So that's where we are aiming for finally. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">If you look into Orthotaxy, we continued to receive great feedback about that platform, especially about its smaller footprint, the fact that it is an imageless system, and the surgeon’s freedom to move within the cutting plain defined by the robot. So -- and that resulted in an overall ease to use, which is greatly appreciated by the surgeons.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And finishing up with Verb, as you expressed the confidence in the platform and the value proposition, we recently successfully completed a series of end-to-end procedures, engaging a group of global KOLs across a subset of target specialties including general and with hernia, colorectal and bariatrics in urologic, in gynecologic and thoracic surgery and we continue to believe our system will address the current limitations of robotic surgeries such as access and reach, the footprint and cost and the workflow and advanced instrumentation to such a much better outcome. I was personally able to operate one of the instruments in the lab and it's really a very impressive new robotic surgical tool. And also overall, the surgeons, their feedback continues to be very positive on the product. So overall, a very good start. Hard work for us and lots of developments to be done but on a very good path.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Great. Thank you, Paul. Thanks Kristen for the questions. Operator, next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Terence Flynn </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I was wondering, on the R&amp;D spend, you mentioned on the pharma side, it sounds like that ramp is mainly external opportunities, but I was wondering if there is any internal programs that you're going to be ramping spend on, if you can be more specific there? And then on DARZALEX any insight you can provide on average treatment duration now and how you see this evolving over time and then any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about pricing the subcu formulation? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Let me start with DARZALEX. I'm telling you that we are very pleased with the progression of DARZALEX. We had a very strong growth in the quarter, with 57%, 41% when you neutralize for the one-time price effects. So we are pleased with the progression -- with the operation of DARZALEX and the strong growth that we are having across all lines of therapy. Particularly, recently we had two important events. One is the approval of the front line indication in eligible patients in the combination with REVLIMID, which was much anticipated and that will give us together with the filing of the also front line indication in transplant eligible will give us three indications in front line.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So to your question on the duration, as we move into earlier lines, the duration of the treatment increases. When it comes to the subcu that we filed earlier this week, we think it is a very important opportunity for DARZALEX overall. Keep in mind that we're going to be able to reduce the infusion time from eight hours that we have today to five minutes. So that's going to give significant advantages in terms of adoption of DARZALEX, in particular it mainly aligns particularly when you think that 50% of the use of DARZALEX today in the US is in oncology clinics in outpatient patients. So we think that this combination is going to make DARZALEX easier to use for physicians, more convenient to patients. If you add to that the number of studies in which we are showing very strong results in front line will pertain for a very positive continue adoption of DARZALEX that we see one of the major drivers of the growth of the Pharmaceutical Group.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Paul Stoffels </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">With regard to the spending internal or external, once we bring in an asset internally, we consider it all as internal spending. The external spending we do is on milestones and that has been an upfront and that has been a very effective way to create value for us. We do less acquisitions, but we invest a lot in external innovation in early stages through collaborations through our JLABS and also through our venture capital and through acquisitions. But once we acquire products, it becomes part of a portfolio and we continue to drive the success of that.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">We have a significant number of internal derived opportunities, let's say, at the moment in the range of 50-50, 60-40 of products coming from our own portfolio as products which we brought in and we invest also something like 50-50 in new products but also as Joaquin was saying, in line extensions. Line extensions are great opportunities to have de-risked products and get additional indications and additional access to patients which grow products faster. And that's why you see us doing on good assets very extensive developments very fast so that indication after indication we can bring to the market.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">That grows a product. Look at DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, now ERLEADA just to name a few. The next generation of TRINZA with a six month so we build on de-risked products also as well as on new platforms as I indicated earlier, with the gene therapy, cell therapy and the new assets which we brought in.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Another area, Terrence, where we are making significant investments is seen in data sciences. We are trying to embed data sciences in everything we do across R&amp;D, to both accelerate discovery and early development and also to improve late development. For example, we are using data sciences to better understand disease expression and progression and also to be more effective at molecular invention. Now, we have models to accelerate molecular design of enemies for high priority targets across all our therapeutic areas. In late development, we are also using data sciences to do a step change in the efficiency in which run clinical trials and also to create synthetic control arms and better stratify patients. So we are embedding as I said, data sciences and making significant investments to be bilingual both in science and in data science.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Terence Flynn </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Great. Thank you, Paul and Joaquin.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thanks Terrence for your questions. Appreciate it. Operator, next question.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Joanne Wuensch </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">I have a specific question and then a big picture one. Specifically, you talked about 100 basis points of supply issues in Medical Devices. I was curious if you could share which devices were impacted and if that's been fully resolved at this stage?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Joanne, thanks for the question. So there were two that were mentioned. Obviously, our first priority is patient safety. One has been remediated and the product is actually back on the market and that's related to our circular staplers. So there was a manufacturing lot that we pulled off the market. Again, it's been remediated and everything is back in order. The second was, during a routine FDA inspection through a third party manufacturer, which is manufacturing SURGIFLO for us. They went through the regulatory filing, identified a change in the manufacturing process. So they were just seeking more information. We're working fully with the FDA and expect that to be resolved shortly.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Joanne Wuensch </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Then my big picture question has to do with the lay of the land in healthcare and how you're looking at patient volumes and pricing and then quoting with that, how are tariffs impacting the business? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Okay. I'll start maybe, and maybe I'll turn over to Joaquin and/or Paul to give you some further insights. But with respect to tariffs first, I would say that, we've had modest impact on our business, nothing that's noteworthy. If you look specifically where most of the rhetoric and dialogue has occurred, it's been around China. Our business in China across all three of our segments has been very strong, high-double digit growth, mid teens or higher across all three segments. So we really haven't seen that impact.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">With respect to pricing, the Pharmaceutical results, again, I think we would all agree, are very strong and that is in the face of net prices declining by 6%, similar to what we saw in 2018. So in the US strong growth. We've got generic and biosimilar erosion and we've got about 6% price headwind, yet the transformational portfolio continues to deliver for patients as well as for our business results. I don't know Joaquin if you want to add anything around the pricing dynamic.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Pricing, we see continued price erosion, which is a dynamic that we have seen in the US market for the last couple of years, which we, as we have commend earlier, more than offset with our volume growth. And overall, we don't see that trend changing. What we think is that in that context, we are positioned most favorably than the rest of the companies because of three reasons. One is the diversification of our portfolio. We had in 2018, 11 medicines of more than a $1 billion. So we are present across many therapeutic areas. Also, we have payer mix which is very similar to the overall market. We don't over index in any particular payer.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">The second thing is that, we have a very robust volume growth. And this volume growth, which is driven by the share that we are gaining and the penetrations through new indications, more than offsets that price adoption. And finally, we do have a strong presence OUS. 45% of our sales are OUS and in this quarter, for example, our sales OUS grew 12.9%. So, overall, we do believe that if we are able to continue to do what we do exceptionally well, which is bringing new breakthrough medicines to patients, we are very well positioned in this context of price erosion.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Great. Thank you. Thanks Joanne for your questions. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Next question is from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Danielle Antalffy </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Just a high level question on devices. I mean based on our math on a comp adjusted basis, you saw another quarter of growth acceleration. I'm just wondering if you could comment on, are we past the trough now in devices and how much of the healthy growth this quarter came -- what was J&amp;J specific versus perhaps a uplift in the various different market growth rates?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Yes. So, great questions Danielle. Yes. We do think that the trough is behind us with respect to Medical Devices. Actually, Ashley McEvoy and her team are doing a great job in terms of ensuring that across all four platforms so, eye, health, cardiovascular, interventional and orthopedics, that we've got solid plans for execution and improved performance going forward, coupled with stronger innovation. So I would say, I don't have a full estimate as to what other competitors' challenges may have added to ours. We've got a ballpark estimate, but I would say, it was probably offset by the supply disruptions that we referenced earlier. So you get back to that normalized level of, let's call it, 3% to 4%.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Danielle Antalffy </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">And then just a higher level comment on the other income upside that you're going to be reinvesting, to follow up on an earlier question. When you do need to scale back spend, given potentially lower other income as we look into 2020 and beyond, what are the levers that you can pull to do that and in which businesses is it easiest to sort of scale back without giving up anything on the top-line?</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">So, we're currently looking to improve the operating margin profile within our Consumer unit. A great job by Thibaut Mongon, Joaquin in terms of really centering and focusing our investment, prioritizing that toward our stronghold of beauty, skin care, as well as over-the-counter medicines. And we are projected to have a strong improvement in that margin profile for this year and then, going forward. I would say the same with Medical Devices. Once you have an improving top line, that should help the rest of the P&amp;L. And Ashley is going about her business that way and making the right structural changes.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And then, lastly, in Pharmaceuticals, we're already at the top of the peer set with respect to operating margin performance, but as that top-line improves and we anniversary some of the challenges that I mentioned earlier, that should also bode well for some, I would say, incremental improvement.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Great. Thanks Danielle. Appreciate the questions. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Next question is from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt Miksic </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Thanks for taking the questions. Just one follow up on pharma, and then, a bigger picture question on Medical Devices. So, you talked a little bit about the XARELTO launch for CAD and PAD maybe taking some time. If you could elaborate maybe on what some of the challenges there, or steps that have to take place to start gaining momentum on that front? And then, I just have one follow up.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Thank you for the question Matt. Certainly, the difference with the launches that we had in other indications like AFib and VTE is that the use of novel oral anticoagulants in CAD/PAD is novel. So we are establishing a new standard of care there. So far it was either aspirin the one medicine used. So, establishing a new standard of care takes longer than when you are comparing to an existing standard of care. So we think that the progression will continue to be like a chronic medication, steady but constantly growing. And as I said, we are exceeding the launch align metrics of BRILINTA and we are similar to ENTRESTO. At this point, just to give you an idea of the extension of the use of XARELTO in CAD/PAD, we have 8,500 prescribers already. So we see a steady climb and we are confident that it would become very important driver of growth for XARELTO.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt Miksic </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just on Medical Devices broadly, I think, one of the questions we get often is just the steps that J&amp;J can take to turn the growth up in this division. Of course, you have bright spots like Biosense Webster and Cerenovus and others in the quarter, which you've talked about. But I wonder if I can ask just what -- robotic surgery is obviously an area where you've invested, continue to invest, but Joe maybe if you could sketch out the areas of Med Devices where you feel like there are disruptive opportunities or areas where J&amp;J can enter, expand, invest and make an impact on this division?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Sure, Matt. So, again, we are seeing improved growth rates from what we were experiencing 12 to 24 months ago. We're continuing on that right cadence I believe. If I look at opportunities as to where we're playing, you mentioned digital surgery, that will be a growth driver going forward. I think in our interventional space, specifically around our Cerenovus unit and stroke, it's a small unit that we don't report out on, but we grew about 25% in the quarter. We think that has tremendous opportunity. We do know that eye health and contact lenses specifically will be a growth driver for us based on the cadence of innovation we've got coming through there.</p>, <p class=""p p17"">And we'll have improved performance with orthopedics. We obviously had some challenges last year with respect to knee performance. As we launch with Orthotaxy at some point late next year or early in '21, as well as bring cementless options to the marketplace, I think we'll be in very good shape, where you'll see this unit performing at or above market.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt Miksic </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">And any things on areas outside the Company that you think about in terms of investing, not just in your businesses but externally like Auris?</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Yes. We're always looking, Matt, across all three of our segments to fortify the portfolio that we have today. There's one or two areas that we're not currently in, but we're going to make sure that: one, we can create value and that asset is in our hands and that we're compensating shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. So we don't just simply look at the cost of capital. There would be some risk opportunity associated with that opportunity that we will make sure that we compensate for. So, I guess that's a long way of saying, we're going to make sure that we pay the right value. We're not in a position were we need to do something. We'll do something when it makes sense to do it from a strategic as well as a financial perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chris DelOrefice </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Thanks Matt. Appreciate the questions. Operator, we have time for one last question.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Your next question will be from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Hopkins </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">I'll be quick. Just two and I'll mention them both upfront. First, on the Pharma side, at the beginning of the year, you guys gave guidance on the headwind from generics and biosimilars of roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion. Can you just give an update on where you stand with that number today? And then, secondly, just a quick clarification on the talc litigation. Are you guys reserving for that currently or no? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joe Wolk </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">So, let me take the talk question quickly. So, we did incur a charge in our earnings for the quarter of $190 million. That is related to defense costs only. That does not contemplate settlement or any liability payments. So again, we think we are on very firm ground with respect to the facts, supporting our case and as I've mentioned on appeal, when we don't win in the original verdicts we prevail on appeal. So that's the only charge that you'll see in there for the quarter, Bob.</p>, <p class=""p p17""><strong><span class=""answer"">Joaquin Duato </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p17"">Thank you, Bob. As I said before, our growth this year is mainly driven by the strength of our core franchises. We have nine medicines growing double digit. And we see all across our franchises very strong growth. We commented DARZALEX with 57%, but also IMBRUVICA 39%, STELARA 18%, TREMFYA doing very well. So overall very positive growth in our core franchises.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">At the same time, we have seen less genetic erosion than anticipated mainly due to two factors. One, it's related to lower generic erosion in ZYTIGA that we anticipated and we think that's going to increase as the year goes on, and also a delay in the introduction of TRACLEER genetic. So we see now our headwind from LOE perspective between $2.5 billion to $3 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong>Chris DelOrefice </strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Great. Thank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our Company. Apologies to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team as needed. I will now turn the call back to Joe for some brief closing remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong>Joe Wolk </strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Thanks, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the call for your interest as well as your time. As you can see in today's results, not just for the quarter but for the first half, we are well set up for both near and long term success. We continue to manage our portfolio to benefit patients, healthcare systems and shareholders and we will continue to invest for impact.</p>, <p class=""p p18"">As we anniversary some of the LOE challenges in Pharmaceuticals and continue our upward momentum in our Consumer Health and Medical Device segments, we feel the business is poised for even greater success going forward. So, again, thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of your day.</p>, <p class=""p p18""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p18"">Thank you.

Welcome to JPMorgan Chase’s second quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak. Ms. Piepszak, please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jennifer Piepszak</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Before I get started, I’d like to thank Marianne for nearly seven years as CFO and for her support of me over many years, but particularly her support during my transition into this role, so a huge thanks to Marianne.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Yes, I just want to add my thanks too. I think Marianne, as we all know, did a great job - smart, honest, thoughtful, helped make the company a better company, so all our thanks goes to Marianne. We also all know that Jennifer is going to do a great job, too.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Jennifer Piepszak</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Jamie. Okay, so now on to the presentation, which as always is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Starting on Page 1, the firm reported record net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $29.6 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 20%. Included in these results are tax benefits of $768 million related to the resolution of a number of tax audits. Adjusting for this as well as a few other notable items that largely offset, we delivered an 18% ROTCE this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; number one in global IBCs year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Overall for the firm, total loan growth was 2% year-on-year but down 1% sequentially. It’s important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm. Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now on to Page 2 and some more detail about our second quarter results. Revenue of $29.6 billion was up $1.2 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was up approximately $900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix, as well as higher rates. Non-interest revenue was up approximately $300 million year-on-year, largely driven by the absence of the card rewards liability adjustment we took in the prior year. Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, non-interest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production, and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IBCs as previously guided. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million. Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.1 billion down 5% year-on-year. In consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat as higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases. And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters. Once again, we do not see any signs of broad-based deterioration across our portfolios, both consumer and wholesale. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now on to balance sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the second quarter with a CET-1 ratio of 12.2%, up more than 10 basis points versus last quarter. In the quarter, the firm distributed $7.5 billion of capital to shareholders, and as you know, the Fed did not object to our 2019 CCAR capital plan. We are pleased to have significant flexibility with gross repurchase capacity of up to $29.4 billion over the next four quarters, and the board announced its intention to increase the common dividend to $0.90 per share, effective in the third quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now on to Page 4 and consumer and community banking. CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31%. Loans were down slightly year-on-year driven by home lending down 7%, reflecting the loan sales I just mentioned; however, card loan growth was healthy, up 8%. Business banking loans were up 2%, and auto loans and leases were flat. We saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 16%, growing across both physical and digital channels. Card sales were up 11% as growth remained strong across key products. Across the franchise, active mobile users were up 12% year-on-year given continued engagement in our new features. For example, customers have opened over 2 million checking and savings accounts digitally, activated over 60 million Chase offers, and our enrollment in credit journey now exceeds 18 million.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Revenue of $13.8 billion was up 11%. This increase included two notable items that largely offset. First, the current quarter included a negative MSR adjustment in home lending driven by updates to our model inputs; and in the prior year, as I mentioned, we had a rewards liability adjustment in cards of approximately $330 million. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Consumer and business banking was up 11% on higher deposit NII, driven by margin expansion. Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In cards, merchant services and auto was up 18%. Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11% driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4% driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges. Of note, the overhead ratio was 52% and we delivered significant positive operating leverage. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">On credit, this quarter included a reserve release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $400 million, reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in cards of $200 million. This was primarily driven by growth, and to a lesser extent mix as the newer vintages naturally season and become a larger part of the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Net charge-offs were up $212 million. Excluding the recovery on a loan sale and home lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up $80 million driven by card, as we continue to grow the portfolio. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now turning to the corporate and investment bank on Page 5, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.6 billion. As a reminder, our performance was particularly strong last year, which featured record or near-record revenues in overall IBCs and equity markets. With that in mind for the quarter, IB revenue of $1.8 billion was down 9% year-on-year in a market that was also down. Advisory, debt underwriting, and equity underwriting fees were down 15%, 13% and 11% respectively, reflecting lower levels of deal activity as well as a 10-year record share in equity underwriting in the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">It’s worth noting on a year-to-date basis, we continue to rank number one overall and have gained share across all products and regions, benefiting from our continued investment in bankers. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">In advisory, we grew share in announced deal volumes and announced more deals than any other bank. In debt underwriting, we also rank number one, benefiting from our strong lead [indiscernible] position in leveraged finance, and in equity underwriting we have seen significant pick-up in activity since the first quarter and we continue to benefit from our leadership positions in tech and healthcare, where there has been robust activity.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Looking forward, the overall IB pipeline is healthy, though lower compared to the elevated activity we saw last year and with fewer acquisition financing and lease financing opportunities in debt underwriting. Dialog with clients remains active and we expect strong deal flow to continue. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Moving to markets, total revenue was $5.4 billion, which was flat year-on-year. Our results include a notable gain in fixed income from the IPO of Tradewind. Excluding this gain, markets revenue would have been down 6% year-on-year against strong second quarter performance last year. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Fixed income markets were down 3% on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in EMEA partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading, due to the changing rate environment. Equity markets was down 12% against a record second quarter last year. [Indiscernible] client activity and a tough compare contributed to a year-on-year decline in equity derivatives; that said, cash in prime remained stable with client balances in prime reaching an all-time high. Treasury services and security services revenues were $1.1 billion and $1 billion, down 4% and 5% year-on-year respectively, with organic growth being more than offset by deposit margin compression.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As a reminder, similar to last quarter, deposit margin was primarily impacted by funding basis compression rather than client betas, and at the firm-wide level there is an offset. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Sequentially, treasury services was flat and security services was up 3% on higher balances and fees. Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. The comps revenue ratio for the quarter was 28%.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now moving onto commercial banking on Page 6. Commercial banking reported net income of $1 billion and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances. Also worth noting here, gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&amp;A advisory activity, and we continue to progress solidly toward our long-term $3 billion target.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Deposit balances were down 1% year-on-year and importantly up 1% sequentially as balances have largely stabilized in total, although we continue to see migration to from non-interest to interest-bearing deposits. Expenses of $864 million were up 2% year-on-year driven by ongoing investments in banker coverage and technology. Loans were at 1% with C&amp;I loans being flat, or up 3% adjusted for the continued run-off in our tax-exempt portfolio. The story here remains unchanged - we saw solid growth in areas where we’ve been investing, including expansion markets in specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activities. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending, where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective, given where we are in the cycle. Finally, credit costs were $29 million with a net charge-off rate of 3 basis points.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now onto asset and wealth management on Page 7. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $719 million with pre-tax margin and ROE of 27%. Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market leverage was offset by lower investment valuation gains. Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees. For the quarter, we saw record net long-term inflows of $36 billion driven by fixed income, and we had net liquidity inflows of $4 billion. AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7% driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels globally. Deposits were up 2% sequentially and up 1% year-on-year, and similar to the commercial bank, balances in total have largely stabilized. Finally, we had record loan balances up 7%, with strength on both wholesale and mortgage lending.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now onto corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $828 million, including the vast majority of the tax benefits that I mentioned earlier. Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year. Expenses of $232 million were down $47 million year-on-year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Finally turning to Page 9 and the outlook, on this page I’ll just comment on NII, which should not be surprising given the changes to the rate environment. As you can see, we are updating our 2019 full-year NII outlook to about $57.5 billion. The reduction is based on multiple scenarios which assume, among other things, lower long end rates and up to three rate cuts this year, which is consistent with current market sentiment. As a reminder, this compares to a rate scenario that assumed zero cuts at the time of first quarter earnings. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">To wrap up, the U.S. consumer remains healthy, overall credit is in great shape, and the earnings power of the company is evident. We delivered strong returns this quarter and the diversification and scale of our business model positions us well to outperform in any environment. Understanding there is some macro uncertainty and potential headwinds from the rate outlook, we still expect to grow the franchise and will continue to strategically invest in our businesses in technology, bankers and beyond.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p4"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">[Operator instructions]</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our first question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. </p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Hey, good morning. I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you feel is driving that uptick, and do you think how sustainable is it at sort of 8% year-over-year growth.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Sure, so on card loan growth, we feel very good about what we’re seeing there. As we talked about at investor day, we have a real opportunity with our existing customers, and we talked about how our existing customers have about $250 billion of borrowing off us. About $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback, so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers, and for the first time, we’re actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers, and so we’re really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the mortgage business, I would say it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent but I would say the structural challenges in that business remain unchanged. And so, we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about de-risking the portfolio from a servicing perspective, so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesn’t change the overall structural challenges. </p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay, thanks. </p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go back to what you were saying earlier in that your guide--or your guide lower is including up to three rate cuts this year, which would suggest to me that your net interest income is quite defensive in the face of rate cuts. I guess my first question is, could you give us your primary assumption for that $500 million swing, particularly on deposit pricing?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay, sure. First of all, I’ll take you back to the first quarter where our guidance was $58 billion-plus, and we talked about some pressure on the long end at that point. That pressure has persisted and in fact increased, and so we pulled the impact of the long end through in terms of our outlook, and then on the short end the range of outcomes are obviously quite broad, and so we thought about a range of outcomes of one to three rate cuts, and so you can think about -- if it’s one cut, $57.5 billion-plus, and if it’s more, $57.5 billion-minus. Then based on current advice, you can think about the third quarter as being $100 million to $150 million below the second quarter, and then a bit more than that in the fourth quarter given we would have a full quarter at that point.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Then in terms of betas, largely speaking you can think of betas as being symmetric, and so on the consumer side we saw little re-price on the way up, and so there is not a lot of opportunity on the way down. On the wholesale side, if you look at large institutional businesses like treasury services and security services, we are largely at full re-price there, so there should be opportunity there. Then in places like the commercial bank and asset and wealth management, we are still ahead of what the model would have assumed, but we have started to see re-price tick up there. But importantly, I would say we’re not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we’ll see how it goes.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">And it’s all embedded in your assumptions.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">And it’s all embedded in the [indiscernible].</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Got it. Just going back to Jim’s question, I noticed that investment securities balances continued to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%. Should we think about this as part of the overall, you were saying optimizing capital and liquidity and therefore as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some relief in RWA growth and some relief in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Sure, so on the RWA side, yes, that is precisely why we’re doing it, and so when you see the loan sales in home lending, yes, they are offset in securities purchases which are more efficient from a capital perspective, as well as a liquidity perspective, so yes.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Having said that, on reserves - I mean, reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that, because of course that will depend upon the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">I would just add, our standardized capital ratio is 12.2, advance is 13. Advance is obviously a far more important relevant economic number. It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and you can’t securitize.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Got it, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. </p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hi. The efficiency ratio went from 56% to 55% year-over-year, and I guess that’s with some accelerated tech spending, so do you plan to keep this pace of tech spending going, and what’s the current update on that tech spending? Where is it connecting, where is it not connecting, because I think you said you’d accelerate it for a couple years and then maybe we’d see more of the results in 2020, 2021.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Could I just take that one? It’s about $11.5 billion today, I think it was a little bit lower last year. If we had to say what it is today for next year, it’d be something like $11.5 billion, and I think it’s always becoming more efficient, but what you really have in tech is some things are becoming cheaper all the time and then you’re also investing money all the time, which we’re going to do regardless of the environment, so we’re not going to cut things we’re trying to build, like My Rewards programs and Chase My Loan and the credit journey because there’s a recession or something like that. Daniel Gordon will tell you right now that they think they get more efficient spend, and we shouldn’t [indiscernible] whatever you want, but we will be happy to spend to win in this business, and we’re very efficient, [indiscernible] how we spend in technology. We’re going to do it regardless of the environment, and we’ll probably get more efficient in tech spend too. </p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">That’s right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest, and we talked a lot about AI and machine learning - it’s early innings there and there’s a lot that we’re going to be able to do to invest there and become more productive, and then cloud, developers can become more productive using the cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">It’s amazing - our [indiscernible] costs with all the things going on in the world today are down because effectively of AI and [indiscernible] and stuff like that, and so it’s hard to [indiscernible]. You mentioned You Invest, you look at our client investment assets grew 16%, a portion of that was You Invest, and obviously You Invest cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, so you’ve got to put all those things in perspective about how you start making decisions going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Then a follow-up, Jamie, you mentioned the environment, all the things taking place in the world. How is the environment now? I mean, on the one hand you have a trade war, you have lower interest rates, you have capital markets which are down to the big banks, you have a lot of pessimism; on the other hand, you highlighted your results. When you take the temperature of the environment, what’s the temperature?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">It’s not that bad. You know, uncertainty is a constant. The one thing in life is you know it’s going to be uncertain going forward, and geopolitical tension is kind of a constant. Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal, but what I think we see is global growth is north of 3%, you kind of expect the United States to be 2.5% this year. The consumer in the United States is doing fine, business sentiment is a little bit worse mostly probably driven by the trade war. You travel around the world, you know, Japan is growing and Europe is growing a little bit, and Brazil has gone from negative-4 to zero. A lot of countries have opportunity to expand. They don’t have to be great but they should be doing better [indiscernible], so I wouldn’t get too pessimistic yet. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Obviously the Fed will react to the data they see, and I would say it’s more important what’s going on that just what the Fed does. If the Fed’s cutting rates and we’re going to recession, that’s not a good rate cut. IF the Fed actually raises rates one day and we’re booming, that’s not so bad. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">All right, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, thanks. I’m not sure if I missed it, but I think total average loans were up 2% year-on-year, but that was impacted by the loan sales. Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year-on-year without that?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, there’s a few things going on in loan growth, as you say, Glenn. We have the loan sales, we also have the run-off of the tax exempt portfolio, so you can think about loan growth probably closer to 4% if you adjust for those items. Importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that we’re seeing in terms of the areas where we’re investing, and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex-CIB of 2% to 3% full year.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, appreciate that. Just curious - on the non-interest bearing deposits only being down 2% year-on-year, we’ve seen a lot bigger numbers at some peers. Is that just strength of JPMorgan’s franchise or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">As I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AUM. We are still seeing some migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but largely we’re seeing those balances stabilize, and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank. The second quarter is typically seasonally high in the consumer bank, so we have some growth in non-interest bearing there, and even in the consumer bank where we’ve seen growth decelerate, that’s largely as a result of consumer spending, so that feels healthy as well.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. Maybe last one. Appreciate the guide on 2019. Because it’s a half, if you looked forward into 2020 with no incremental rate cuts, is it remotely linear? In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate and curve environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to over-simplify like that?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, it’s probably more complicated, Glenn. Just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are, and importantly if we’re looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about, so we’re not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, thank you, appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, good morning. When you take a look at your merchant services business, you had some really strong growth year-over-year - I think it was up 12%, and then your card volumes excluding the commercial card were also up very strong. Can you share with us what’s driving that strong growth, that double digit rate of growth?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks for noticing.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">I would say that is firing on all cylinders, so it’s brand, it’s people, it’s product. It does certainly help to have the backdrop of a healthy U.S. consumer as well, and in fact retail sales this morning look strong, so we can expect that to continue.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Is it more the market as you just referenced - the retail sales, they were strong - is it more that, or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, we have taken share, a little bit of share in card. As you know, we’re number one in sales there. I think importantly, what’s helpful in card is that we don’t even need to take share to grow, just given the secular tailwind that we have in the card business on the electronification of cash, and we’re taking share in merchant acquiring.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And we expect to take more share in the future.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Speaking of the future, can you guys give us some color on what your first read of Libra is, the Facebook announcement about the payments system that they’re going to initiate?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, so to put it in perspective, Gerry, we’ve been talking about Blockchain for seven years and very little has happened, and you’re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn’t spend too much time on it. We don’t mind competition and the request is always going to be the same - the governments are going--you need one level playing field, and governments are going to insist that people who hold money or move money all live according to rules where they have the right controls in place. No one wants to, a, [indiscernible] terrorism or criminal activities, and that’s going to be true for everybody involved in this, and that’d be banks even doing [indiscernible] for a long period of time, and those [indiscernible] I think will just become for everybody at one point, and they should. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">John McDonald</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi. I wanted to ask about the CCAR, and you got a big authorization this year. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET-1 target, the 11 and 12 that you’ve talked about?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Sure. As we think about capital distribution, first we would start by always saying that we prefer to use our capital to invest and grow our businesses, and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend, and only then to return excess capital to our shareholders. We are pleased with the approval and the additional capacity to return that $29.4 billion to shareholders; having said that, we are still targeting the upper end of the 11 to 12% range. We’re always going to want to have a management buffer, because as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses, and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Then importantly, we wouldn’t actually need to make that decision for a few more quarters, given the way the capital distribution plan is laid out over four quarters, but as of now we are still targeting the upper end of 11 to 12%. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">John McDonald</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay, thanks Jen. Any updated thoughts on FISO, or could you remind us what your thoughts on initial impact there? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Sure, so haven’t changed from investor day. Our range continues to be $4 billion to $6 billion, and we’re prepared for the January 1 implementation. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Just to [indiscernible], so CCAR is one test a year on stress. We do 120 a week, so we are always prepared for stress. CCAR has us losing $20 million or $30 million over nine consecutive quarters. I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made $20 million to $30 million, and CCAR assumes you’re going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes you’re going to continue your dividend and stuff like that. We have plenty of capital - I mean, our capital cup runneth over and we’d [indiscernible] that capital. Remember, things like opening branches, for every branch we’ll eventually use $10 million of capital, so four new branches will eventually be $4 million of capital, so restraints on growth also restrains on capital usage and the ability to finance the U.S. economy, so we’re really optimistic about our ability to somehow use our capital, including like the InstaMed acquisition we just did, which I think closes sometime soon, so.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hey, good morning. Jamie, you mentioned about Blockchain, we’ve been hearing about it for seven years and not much has happened, but I think you at JPM have built a Blockchain solution for at least your correspondent banks. I guess I wanted to understand where you think you’re planning on taking that. Right now, it’s just an AML KYC use case, but is that something that you think you could deliver more functionality over, over time?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">We think the Blockchain is real, and the reason it takes so long is people have to agree to the protocols, you have to write a lot of code to get into it. The one you’re referring to, IAN, is think of an information network for banks, so right now banks transfer live information among each other - think of trade finance and correspondent banking and stuff like that, so I think we have 120 banks signed up, we’re going to have 400. So right now, it’s for bank wholesale use to have immediate information, we all have the same information, you can move things; but eventually, you’ll be able to move money quicker with data, so yes, we’re optimistic about that and we’re going to roll that out as soon as we can and constantly test it and make sure it’s secure and all that. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">I remind people when it comes to moving money, JPMorgan Chase moves $6 trillion a day quite securely and quite cheaply. You’ve got to look at the problem you’re trying to solve, but people legitimately said, well, you didn’t have real time payments - that was true, and now we do effectively sell from P to P, and we do effectively [indiscernible] real-time payments in TCH, so we are building the things that the future is going to want - APIs, Blockchain ledgers that have much more data, real-time moving of money that also goes through floor checks, etc. We’re quite optimistic about it. It’s going to take a while to get everyone using it. One day it’ll have to be opened up to a broader customer set, possibly.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">One of the things that’s coming out in these senate and house financial services banking committee meetings is this desire for real-time payments, a desire for a cheaper solution for payments, and that’s supposedly what Libra is going to offer; but to your point, it seems like you’re already doing that. The question is, how do we think about the outlook for interchange, and is there--you know, what’s your strategy towards interchange pricing here as we go over this, through this period?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">[Indiscernible] there is real-time P2P free save and secure [indiscernible], so when people say do it, that’s already done. That’s not cross-border, so there are people who might want to do that cross-border, and cross border remittances are much, much smaller than actual use of debit card, credit card payment systems here, [indiscernible] built in real-time payments is actually already in use. To me, the issue there is going to be fraud - you know, to make sure with these real-time payments, you also put it through effectively real-time floor checks and stuff like that. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">You know, in the United States, credit cards, debit cards, people love these cards. The beneficiary is the consumer. Always remember, that’s who we’re here to serve, and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards. They use their credit cards far more than they use their debit cards. I don’t remember the last I used my debit card.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes, when you get rewards, it’s great. Okay, thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And at JPMorgan, they’ll be getting more free stuff. You get free--you can buy and sell stock for free. We just gave you a very good--it just got rolled out, we only have a few accounts, but local investing, very cheap, very clear. So we’re going to take and give our clients more and better and faster and cheaper all the time, and now we package that with [indiscernible] banking and [indiscernible] card, or discounts on mortgages. That all remains to be seen, but the future is very bright. If we can do more for our customers, that’s a very good thing. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And don’t forget on credit cards, you get chargeback rights and you get the flows.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Right, and you get--you go online, you’re a Chase customer, you get your FICO score for free, you’re going to be able to--we’re going to tell customers [indiscernible] how they can improve their FICO score. You get offers like this Chase [indiscernible] - I mean, we don’t really market it, but it’s really taken off.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure, so the Chase [indiscernible], we talked about that at investor day. It’s like a really powerful flywheel where we can deliver value to our large merchant clients in terms of being able to bring a very large customer base to them, and then we can deliver that value to our customers at zero cost to us. So as I said in the presentation, we’ve had over 60 million Chase offers activated, so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers but our large merchant clients, and at zero cost to us.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So that message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the Hill as well.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, and we talk to the Hill all the time and a lot of people understand that. Of course, they always want you to do a better job for consumers, which we have been.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, I guess the final question here is just on the under-banked. Is there something, or is than an offer than you have for them? Are you considering that, because I’m just thinking about where fintech’s is trying to exploit you, and I know it’s a catchphrase - under-banked, that is being used by [indiscernible], doesn’t necessarily seem like it’s solving anything for them, but maybe you’ve got a better solution that we just don’t focus on.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">We have [indiscernible]. I think 25% of our branches are [indiscernible] neighbourhoods. We go to those neighborhoods, we do some philanthropy, we’re doing more and more financial education, which I think is really important. I just mentioned the FICO score, but thing is there might be other things we can do. We do Chase Chat, so it’s get people into the branch to educate them about saving, FICO scores, what you can do to get a mortgage to buy a house and stuff like that. Then we have a product, which really is great, called Secure Banking, and think of it as a card but it’s the full thing. You can overdraft, I think it’s $4.95 a month, but you can use ATMs, you can have direct deposit, you can do online mobile payments and stuff like that, so we think that’s a great product for the under-banked. I think that’s going now 25% or--and we’ve kind of pushed that a little bit more, so we’re always trying [indiscernible]. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">Then we also have special, I call it venture banking, [indiscernible] fund. We’re making loans [indiscernible] non-traditional bank loans that help grow your businesses, so we’re finding a lot of ways to do it and [indiscernible] understand it. I would say we’re at the forefront of that. Fintech, of course is always going to try to eat your lunch, and I think that’s good, that’s called American capitalism, and we have to stay on our toes to compete. But we are. When Jen was at cards, she rolled out last year [indiscernible] Chase My Plan and Chase My Loan, so that people can use their credit balances immediately to do what they want to do and do it well. We rolled out Zelle P2P, that’s good for everybody, so if you have a bank account, you can move money to your friends and relatives without even paying the $10 money changer fees and stuff like that. We’re all-in trying to do a better job for the American consumer, and we think we do a great job for them, and if there are legitimate complaints, we’ll fix it.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">That’s right, and you mentioned the 25% in LMI [indiscernible] in our expansion markets, that’s 30%.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks a lot, good morning. Just wanted to ask on the balance sheet last year, so you’ve seen a huge jump in the trading related assets, and I know you had the accounting change that you mentioned in the supplement. But could you talk about, is that related to market share gains, is it related to just specific strategies with regard to managing liquidity, and it doesn’t seem to be equally growing on the asset side in the trading liability, so just can you explain the dynamics behind that now that adds to the net interest income story? Thanks. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure, so in terms of the balance sheet growth that you saw quarter over quarter, that was primarily related to our balance sheet intensive businesses in the markets businesses, and then we were down on a spot basis quarter over quarter. But you know, we start with deposit growth and so we have had strong deposit growth, so you see that reflected on the balance sheet side as well, and you would have seen securities balances up as well, and some of that is adding duration and some of that is short duration securities that are higher yielding than IOER, and--yes.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay, so it is part of the liquidity management strategy? Okay. Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">[Indiscernible] if you get a higher return in repo than you get in IOER, you’re going to do that. If you get a higher return in standardized--using standardized capital on securities than you are on wholly owned loans, you’re going to do that, and that’s what we’ve seen in some of these things.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">That’s right, the securities growth, I should have mentioned was [indiscernible] due to the home sales and home lending.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Right, okay, got it. That makes sense. Did you say what the--can you tell us what the amount of the gains on the loan sales this quarter were, if they were above trend? </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">We haven’t disclosed the amounts of the gains, and we had some loan sales in the fourth quarter, the first quarter and in the second quarter. The first and second quarter in terms of the notional amount, the first quarter was about $7 billion and the second quarter was about $9 billion, so just a little bit more.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">The gains in the second quarter net-net were--they show up in different places, but not much, not material.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Got it. Lastly, just any thoughts on the investment banking pipeline and the continuation of the outlook across the buckets there? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure. In terms of the investment banking pipeline, I’ll just remind you that the third quarter is typically a seasonally lower quarter, and so sequentially you should think about IBCs being down a bit. That said, the pipeline is healthy, although off a record performance last year which is assumption of a reversion to more normal level activity, as well as some overhang from macro uncertainty. In M&amp;A, still feels very healthy and is still a space where companies are looking for synergistic opportunities for growth, especially in North America, perhaps Europe a bit more muted. ECM, we had a very strong second quarter, so that will taper off in the second half a bit, but I would say deals are getting done well in the current environment. Then DCM, DCM will be more subdued, reflecting a slowdown in acquisition financing activity as well as refinancing opportunities, but albeit with a good backdrop for new issuance given the rate environment. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question is from Matt O’Connor of Deutsche Bank. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt O’Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning. I realize rate expectations can change quickly, but how do you think about managing the company in a rate environment that follows the curve that’s out there for three to four cuts? You said earlier you wouldn’t cut back on technology, but are there other areas in expenses? Do you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different? </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure, so in terms of balance sheet management, we manage the balance sheet in both directions. It’s a negatively convex balance sheet, and so all else being equal, as rates are declining we would naturally just drift shorter, driven both by assets and by liabilities, so you would expect us to add duration, which we did this quarter. But we’re not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment, we’re going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline, and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration. Then in terms of expenses, again we’re not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment, and I’ll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts, it’s a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about. But as Jamie always says, we’re not going to change the way we run the company because of the macro environment.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">That said, in a broader slowdown obviously there are natural levers on volume-related expenses, and we re-decision a large part of our investment portfolio on an annual basis. We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity, depending upon the opportunity, to take a look at that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Remember in a real recession, there are always opportunities for [indiscernible] and vendors fall all over themselves to give you better deals and stuff like that. There are also huge opportunities to spend your money wisely, so the Sapphire card was birthed in ’09 and you could imagine that--you say okay, we have this great opportunity but we’re not going to take it, and so I think you’ve got to be very careful. The other thing is, marketing money is usually better spent in a downturn, the returns on it usually double.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt O’Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And you talked about the capital and your thought process there. Obviously the authorization of the buyback is a very big number. Is it your expectation that you’ll use it all, or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price, and the environment? </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I would say still to be determined. Our first choice will always be to use our excess capital to invest and grow our business, so still to be determined. As you know, it’s over four quarters and so we have time to think about it, but obviously pleased to have the flexibility.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Matt O’Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Is the timing of that even, or is there flexibility there too?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It has been in the past, but we can change that every day.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hey, good morning. A couple of questions. First on the NII outlook beyond this year, I fully appreciate you’re not giving guidance beyond this year, but you do have the guidance from investor day out there of a sustainable NII of $58 billion to $60 billion, that was set in a very, very different rate environment. If we were to see multiple rate cuts, how do we think about that guidance, and what are some of the moving parts that might get you perhaps to the lower end of that $58 billion to $60 billion? Is it simply dependent upon how the economy responds, deposit pricing? If you can just kind of outline what you think some of those moving parts are.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure, so the guidance we gave at investor day, steady state 58 to 60, I would say largely still stands, importantly because when we talked about that at investor day, we weren’t assuming any further benefit from rates, so we were assuming that any incremental increases in rates would be offset in re-price, and so the majority of that growth was going to come from balance sheet growth and mix. If you remember the slide, there were a number of arrows on the slide even at that time, which was obviously a different rate environment. We were implying that there were a number of different paths to get there, so that obviously continues to be true, so there may be a different path to get there. It may take a little bit longer, but we still believe in that steady state number because we still believe in the growth of the franchise. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay, that’s helpful. If I could change gears a little bit, you recently announced that you’re closing Finn, or you closed Finn, and I think the stated logic is you learned that millennials don’t need a separate brand or experience. But can you just elaborate on the logic there and what you learned from that experience, because it does seem to maybe fly in the face of what some other entities or financial institutions are doing with their digital banking strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">We learned a lot in Finn. You said it, that we learned that importance of the power of the Chase brand certainly means that we don’t need a separate brand. We also learned about a number of features that our customers love, and we were able to reuse those features and port them over to the Chase mobile app. I think we always need to be testing and learning and doing things like this, and not afraid to shut them down when we’ve learned what we needed to learn and can serve our customers through the primary Chase mobile app.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">We learned a lot, like how to do digital account openings only digital. When you do it out of a retail bank, you tend to rely on what you already have, so there were a lot of lessons there. We’re always going to be learning from kind of skunkworks and learning from things like that, so we don’t look at those kind of things like failures at all. That is how you learn, and Jeff Bezos will tell you mistakes are good, mistakes are what make you smarter and better, and so I hope we made some really good mistakes that can teach us at all of our businesses at one point. The people doing Finn did a great job, they’re embedded, and by the way, you can open a Chase account now and never go into a branch. You can open an account [indiscernible] it takes minutes to open an account, so we got much better at digital only [indiscernible] separated from the physical branch system.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jennifer Piepszak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, and the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And we’ll be doing it in small business and merchant processing and all these various things. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Got it, okay. Thanks very much.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Compton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. This question kind of ties into some of the items already mentioned - longer term tech focus, and also related to Finn. There has been some press recently about reasons for closing down the Finn app, and one of the items that was mentioned was some of the difficulties banks can potentially run into with their legacy platforms, which for the most part are built on COBOL, which has been around since the sixties and depending on who you talk to, these legacy platforms can either be huge problems for banks or not really a big deal. I guess from the outside, at least for me, it can be kind of hard to tell what really is going on there, so my question is as you compete with fintech firms who are building new platforms from scratch, how do you strategically view dealing with your own legacy platforms? Is there a need to kind of re-do these things eventually in order to actually compete with newer tech over time? Do these legacy platforms really hamstring you in any way, or is the hype around those issues really overdone, and if so, why? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Jamie Dimon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">The hype has been around now for the better part of a decade, right, and we seem to be doing fine. But there is truth--and some of these legacy platforms are also the reason why you have 50 million customers, but it is true that over time, these platforms need to be reformulated and re-factored to be cloud eligible and things like that, and those things are more efficient so your costs will go down, your error rates will go down. The way I’d look at it a little bit is we run 6,000 or 7,000 applications. Over time, those will be marginalized and being re-factored to be cloud eligible [indiscernible] the cloud, very public cloud, and yes, they will be more efficient. But we’ve also had tons of new digital platforms, AIs that are built around these things that do the customer service side [indiscernible] to open accounts in minutes, to get your free credit journey, that we can modify so many things in days and weeks as opposed to years because you’re not monkeying with the whole legacy system, so it’s a little bit of both. But those numbers are embedded in our tech spend - the re-factoring, building data centers, getting better [indiscernible] AI, they’re all in those numbers.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">We have no further questions at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Well, thank you very much. Jen, you did a great job. We’ll talk to you all in a quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Jennifer Piepszak</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks everyone. Thanks Jamie. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you for participating in today’s call. You may now disconnect.</p>]"

Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Mike Cieplak</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Steve Easterbrook</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We're pleased to be speaking to you today from our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago, where we recently celebrated our one year anniversary in this contemporary urban facility.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Returning to Chicago was a deliberate move to get closer to our customers and the trend shaping business and society today. Our new facility was designed to be a modern and inspiring environment, a catalyst for our evolving culture.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our move is also a metaphor for the momentum we're seeing across our business. Momentum has been building since we first launched our turnaround plan. As we've recently passed the four-year mark, I thought, it would be important to spend a few minutes reflecting on our journey.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Back in May 2015, I announced our initial steps to reset and rebuild our business, including our three-fold priorities of driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brands, and unlocking financial value.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At the time, we were keenly aware that the pace of change inside McDonald's is being eclipsed by the pace of change outside our business. We knew, we had to evolve with our changing market and consumer dynamics, and we knew incremental progress wasn't going to cut it. Returning to a growth company was going to require big, bold steps and greater personal accountability.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We knew success would be determined by the fast beating the slow, by choosing progress over perfection, and moving with a sense of urgency. So, we set out on the journey to become faster, smarter and more responsive to changing consumer expectations. We restructured to be closer to customers and faster at the point of impact. We refranchised to drive growth and bring greater insights at a local level. We increased accountability and financial discipline and returned cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we returned to operating growth. Indeed, within two years, we established a strong foundation, one that was fit for purpose, and brought the business to a place where we could begin accelerating growth again.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">That led to the launch of our Velocity Growth Plan in March of 2017. The plan is rooted in building on the fundamentals that have served our Company so well for over 60 years. It's about running better restaurants, offering a compelling menu of delicious and affordable food, and complementing that with hospitality and convenience for our guests.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We know that when we create delicious, feel good moments for customers, every visit every day, customers recognize our efforts and reward us with repeat visits. We also know that we must continuously complement that work with big and powerful moves that keep us relevant and inviting for new generations of guests.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We deployed three accelerators to help us do just that, our Experience of the Future or EOTF; digital and delivery. With these efforts, we have focused on actions that have the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time. That's the path to becoming a better McDonald's.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Four years in, we did the hard work to put the Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators firmly in place, and we are energized by the broad-based strength in our results.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">For the quarter, global comparable sales increased 6.5%, which marks four full years of quarterly comp sales growth. This was complemented by positive global comp guest counts.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">During the quarter, we made strong gains in running great restaurants. We still have work to do, because speed of service is so important to our customers, seconds matter and impact decisions they make on repeat visits.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're leveraging the power of the system, franchisees, suppliers and employees to reduce menu complexity, improve operational procedures, deploy new drive-thru crew competitions and incentives, adopt best practices for staffing, and leverage new technologies to make it easier for our teams to take responsibility for performance. And we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We set market level targets early this year and have dropped service times across many markets globally. They're providing a better experience for our customers, and with that seeing record high customer satisfaction scores this summer.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Here in the U.S., the plan we built with our franchisees is ambitious. Collectively, we recognized the need for change, and knew it’d be hard work. We spent 2018, deploying major initiatives, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization, and the restructuring of U.S. field operations.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">At the beginning of this year, we said 2019 would be a year to execute on running better restaurants and optimize the initiatives we deployed last year. In restaurant visits with franchisees around the country, I'm seeing the results of focused execution against the plan. Importantly, average franchisee restaurant cash flow has grown eight consecutive months through June, fully overcoming the decline we saw in 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Across our International Operated Markets or IOM, we’re seeing continued success. Consistent execution against the Velocity Growth Plan is a winning formula.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I had the pleasure to visit Italy during the quarter and witnessed firsthand a rigorous focus on operational innovations and improvements. Italy now has posted 10 consecutive quarters of comp sales and guest count growth with double-digit comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In fact, Italy has outperformed the local Informal Eating Out or IEO category for nearly two years now. I saw similar energy and focus when I went from Italy to Poland, which also posted strong comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter. This high-performing market was an early adopter of EOTF and digital. In Warsaw, I saw the positive impact our guest experience leaders have on hospitality, as they greeted customers with a special warmth that made guests feel welcome.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Italy and Poland are great examples of markets where we start a best practice and replicate it at scale across other markets. Whether around EOTF rollout, hospitality, operations, or digital, ideas originate in one market and rapidly move to another, creating an environment where all boats rise.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper dive into our comp sales trends by market and performance drivers.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Kevin Ozan</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our top-line momentum remains strong. As Steve mentioned, global comp sales increased 6.5% for the quarter with each operating segment contributing meaningfully to our growth. In the U.S., comp sales were up 5.7%, our highest comp sales increase since the launch of all day breakfast back in the fourth quarter of 2015. And once again, we also grew comp sales across all dayparts.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Performance drivers for the quarter included proven value and deals such as our national 2 for $5 Mix &amp; Match promotion, featuring our core menu items, as well as other locally relevant offers.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our renewed focus on our iconic core menu, resonates well with our customers. Since switching the fresh beef for our Quarter Pound burgers just over a year ago, our sales results and positive customer response confirm it was the right strategic move.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the first half of 2019, we sold over 55 million more Quarter Pound burgers compared to last year. A combination of both deal offers and line extensions, featuring bacon and DeLuxe builds on our classic Quarter Pounder with cheese helped to boost sales. Similar to last quarter, the sales benefit from our modernized EOTF restaurants contributed to our overall U.S. comp performance, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">By taking learnings from completed projects, we've successfully reduced construction downtime, and we're also recovering sales quicker, after reopening.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">During the quarter, we converted an additional 600 restaurants to EOTF for a total of 1,000 projects completed in the first half of this year. We still expect to complete a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Strong average check growth from both product mix and pricing continues to fuel our top-line in the U.S. We're seeing success with offerings that increase average check, traffic and cash flow, such as our current worldwide favorites, LTO. However, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains a top priority in the street fight for market share.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning outside the U.S. Strong balanced results continued across the International Operated segment with comp sales up 6.6% for the quarter. Each of the markets within the segment grew comp sales, and nearly all of the markets also grew comp guest counts. Strong results in the UK, France and Germany were key contributors to the segment’s growth.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The UK marked its 53rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and increased market share versus our competition across all dayparts. Maximizing delivery was a key success factor for the market, along with menu innovation, such as the bacon roll breakfast sandwich and the Taste of America burgers LTO.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">France has been successful with both its premium and core burger offerings, balanced with a compelling value platform, helping the market to again achieve record high market share. France now has nine consecutive quarters of both comp sales and guest count growth.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And Germany is maximizing contributions from EOTF, our core menu and strong value messages, all of which resonate with their customers. Germany also gained market share versus competitors, and customer satisfaction scores are up.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the International Developmental Licensed segment, comp sales increased 7.9% with sales and guest count growth across each geographic region within the segment. Results across our three largest markets drove the strong sales performance with double-digit growth in Brazil, strong comps in Japan and positive performance in China. Accelerated new restaurant growth by our strategic partners, primarily in China, led the segment to grow system-wide sales by 10% for the quarter in constant currencies.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now, I'll turn it back to Steve to further discuss the growth accelerators driving our global business.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Steve Easterbrook</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Over the past four years, we've seen unprecedented changes in the global consumer landscape. With this proliferation of change, consumers today expect more from us. Quality, service and convenience are more important than ever. And of course, delicious food served by welcoming people is absolutely essential.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Accelerators of our Velocity Growth Plan are all about giving our global customers more control over how they order, how they pay, and how they serve their food.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the U.S., we've made significant progress in modernizing our restaurants through our Experience of the Future initiative. We have now modernized over 8,500 U.S. restaurants. Today, customers are much more like to visit EOTF restaurants than they were just a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">At the end of May, I was honored to join our team in New York for the opening of our new Time Square restaurant. Our three-storey restaurant is a major brand statement on how we're providing a better customer experience through décor, enhanced customer service and seamless order and pay technologies.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our major IOM markets have had Experience of the Future for some time and we’re continuing to unlock this potential. For example, in Australia and our major European markets, over 40% of in-store customers now use kiosks when dining with us, taking control of how they order, customize their food and select how to be served. From New York to Sydney and most places in between, our restaurants are not just ready for the future, they are meeting customers on their terms today.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Delivery is another area where we're taking bold action to meet customers’ expectations for high quality food on their terms with increasing demands for convenience and speed. We've made significant progress on delivery the past two years and have room to grow in a largely untapped market with great upside. Driving customer awareness and trial about the McDelivery remains a top priority.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Globally, we expect delivery to be a $4 billion business in 2019 for McDonald's and franchise restaurants. Across our major markets, we've maintained double-digit delivery sales growth in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the UK and Spain, delivery now accounts for greater than 10% of sales in restaurants that offer delivery. In the U.S. McDelivery with Uber Eats is now available in more than 9,000 restaurants, which is more than half of all McDonald's U.S. restaurants.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">They're also continuing to add new partners that allow us to scale and deploy delivery to meet untapped customer demand. We recently announced a partnership in the U.S. with DoorDash to expand the availability and accessibility for customers to receive our delicious food wherever they are. We will quickly scale with DoorDash across the U.S. to provide customers with a choice of delivery partners.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Canada, we've seen incremental strength in delivery with our second national partner, SkipTheDishes. We offer delivery in 850 restaurants in Canada, many of which offer delivery from both partners. Multiple delivery partners now are also the norm in Italy, Spain and Russia, where we're learning from our partners whilst driving increased delivery orders.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We're also taking bold action on digital. Since closing the Dynamic Yield acquisition in April, we launched the decision logic technology on digital menu boards in drive-thrus across multiple regions in the U.S. Customers have responded to the point-of-sale suggestive selling by adding french fries, drinks, Chicken McNuggets and other favorites to their orders. We're already seeing an increase in average check by improving our ability to offer customers what they are likely to want with suggestions based on time of day, weather, and items already in customers’ orders.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We introduced Dynamic Yield technology in Australia this month, and we'll increase the number of drive-thrus in the U.S., using the technology from about 700 today to over 8,000 in the next two weeks. By year-end, we plan to integrate the technology in nearly 100% of our drive-thrus in both markets. This is another example of using technology to create more engaging experiences for our guests.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The technology infrastructure we’ve built over the past three years to support our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators is fundamental to our transformation. It's a reflection of what our customers demand from us, and it's not static. Digital capabilities change by the day and impact what customers ultimately expect from us. The technological ecosystem we're building will enable us to meet these rising expectations, positioning us for new opportunities to elevate and transform the customer experience.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for a look into the financial results for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Kevin Ozan</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 grew 7% in constant currencies for the quarter when excluding impairment and other strategic charges from both the current and prior years. Our results have benefited from strong operating performance for the quarter. Revenue grew 3% in constant currencies as our comp sales growth more than offset the impact of refranchising activity.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Adjusted operating margin for the first half of the year was 43.2%, an increase of 30 basis points versus last year. As a result of our franchising efforts over the past few years, the largest component of operating income is our franchise margin dollars. With growth of 9% in constant currencies for the quarter, franchise margin dollars now represent nearly 85% of total restaurant margin dollars. Our consolidated franchise margin percent declined 100 basis points as our strong sales performance was impacted by higher EOTF related depreciation in the U.S., as well as 70 basis points from the lease accounting presentation change that I discussed last quarter. As a reminder, this presentation change has no effect on our franchise margin dollars, but the impact to our franchise margin percent will be ongoing.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to our company-operated restaurants. Consolidated margins grew 20 basis points to 18.1% for the quarter. IOM segment company-operated margins were flat versus prior year, as our strong sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor and other costs, such as delivery commissions.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">U.S. company-operated margins grew 40 basis points to 16.3%, reflecting strong sales performance and refranchising, partially offset by continued commodity and labor pressures, along with higher EOTF-related depreciation.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Second quarter pricing for both the U.S. and the big five markets in the IOM segment, was up about 2.5%, while commodity costs were up a similar amount across these markets. In the U.S., we expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat in the back half of the year and still expect our grocery basket to be up 2% to 3% for the full year. For the big five markets in the IOM segment, we expect a full year commodity cost increase to be up roughly 2.5%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">G&amp;A was 2.1% of system-wide sales for the quarter and flat to prior year in constant currencies. We still expect G&amp;A for the full year to remain relatively flat in constant currencies versus last year, as we continue to invest in digital and technology capabilities.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, and we continue to expect a full year tax rate between 24% and 26%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our second quarter results by $0.07 per share, given the strength of the U.S. dollar. At current exchange rates, we expect the foreign currency impact to lessen to $0.02 to $0.04 for Q3 with further easing into Q4. Our estimated full year headwind remains at $0.18 to $0.20. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Steve Easterbrook</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">I've begun my remarks this morning by talking about momentum. The momentum we're building is apparent to our customers who seek the convenience and value of McDonald's great tasting food. It’s apparent to our people; it’s apparent to industry observers who are watching our transformation. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Getting to these results wasn't easy. And we need to continue to work hard to sustain performance as we face macroeconomic and industry uncertainties around the world. While we remain confident in our strategies, customers are rewarding us for the investments we're making to offer them great tasting food, a modern and hospitable environment, and unparalleled convenience.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We all want to be associated with companies, organizations and brands that engage and inspire us, brands that are inclusive, fun, relevant and successful, brands that strive to improve communities and societies at large. That's where we're headed as we continue to unlock the potential of the Velocity Growth Plan and these accelerators. And it is why you'll see us continue to focus on our innovation and technology pipelines. This is our version of success.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We're building a better McDonald’s for a culture of innovation focused on a better customer experience, a culture that strives to make the jobs of restaurant employees easier, and a culture that is focused on sustaining long-term growth. This is our mindset as we push ourselves to execute our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators with the strong sense of urgency, passion, and commitment.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, we'll open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">[Operator Instructions]</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Charles</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Great. Thanks. Steven, can you give a little more context to the mix growth in U.S. that seems to be accelerating? Certainly outperformance outside the lower ticket breakfast occasion that's continued, as well as lapping $1 $2 $3 from last year helps. But, I think investors are wondering about the endurance, the customers’ ability to continue to pay up, absent any growth in traffic. Relatively, the most tangible driver may be Dynamic Yield as we look forward. In the 700 stores that have added the initiative so far, have you experienced the consistent lift to sales, particularly on mix, once the drive-thru adds the initiative, or have the lifts of sales been more varied? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks, Andrew. As you say, clearly, this is a check-driven sales comp growth in the U.S. What I think is encouraging for us and gives us confidence that we build more sustaining platforms. It's the balance of how that check is built. So, we're about two-thirds improved product mix and one-third improved price. So, I think that's a fairly healthy balance.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">When you kind of drill into it, I mean, there's a number of elements that play in it, so helping with this. So, if we just look at some of the menu activity and promotional activity through the quarter for instance, there was a good local co-op initiative, which -- menu development co-ops initiative, particularly for the Easter period on the Filet-O-Fish promotion, which gave us an incremental lift. We've been pleased with the way the Worldwide Favorite promotion has worked, and that's beating or maybe this one exceeding our targets and is giving us incremental business.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As we continue to innovate around the kind of the heart of the group platform, the Quarter Pounder cheese with different options around lettuce and tomato, that also works along with -- we actually realized lift on the Happy Meal business, particularly now we've reestablished the relationship with Disney. So, I think, there's a number of elements through just the menu and marketing piece that have given us -- building on platforms that has taken us a while to invest in or operationally embrace, but is now beginning to deliver more consistent results.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Also we’re seeing, as we convert the EOTF restaurants here, we're getting an incremental sales lift from that, some of which will come through growing and increasing use of the self order kiosks where we generate higher average checks as we mentioned before.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Alongside delivery -- don't forget delivery, remember, very much -- as that becomes a large part of our business, we’re still seeing about twice the average check on the typical delivery order as well. So, there's a number of contributors. It's not a one single contribution, or if you look through right across the business, I think it’s the culmination. A lot of the initiatives that we've been investing in the last two or three years are beginning to come together, which is giving us encouragement.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">On Dynamic Yield, we've been really pleased. I'm going to say sort of three months in, couldn't be more pleased with the integration of Dynamic Yield, both as a company and as a culture, but also, frankly, getting the capabilities into our restaurants. So, we've been running 700 restaurants now for the best part of two and a half months. We're seeing consistent trends across different dayparts, across different days of week, across those 700. And that's certainly encouraged us with the support of our owner/operators, of course, to quite significantly accelerate the rollout. We know the technology works, we can plug it into our existing outdoor digital menu boards. So, we're going to go from about 800 now to 8,000 by this time, in two weeks’ time, which is fantastic. And we would expect to see -- we have no reason to believe that the kind of lifts we are beginning to see, and I'm not going to go into those details, but kind of lifts we're seeing at the moment, we expect to continue across obviously the accelerated rollout.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">What’s also been really encouraging to us on that front, it’s subject to Dynamic Yield. We've taken it into our first international market and have gone very, very quickly from that 20 restaurants to 150 in Australia. The reason that's important is because -- and I don't want to get too much into it, but the content management system, the kind of the brain, which holds all the data, which Dynamic Yield product works after that produce work, we can show on the digital menu boards. Internationally, they have one typical content management system, and the U.S. has another. And we've been able to prove very, very quickly that the technology works on both platforms, which really indicates this is ready for a global expansion. So, we'll be careful that we don't get over our skis on it. But, the pulse of the market is strong. The excitement of the owner/operators is great. And the most probably rewarding or one of the most rewarding elements, one of the business results is it just makes the managers and crew life easier in the restaurant as well. And order-taking process is a little quicker because we don't have to manually suggest to sell, the technology does it for you.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So, that is a long answer. But plenty of -- wide variety of initiatives, are helping support that. And not least by the way, just the fact that we’re actually running the restaurants better. The focus we put on the drive-thrus, which I spoke about the last quarter, we’re seeing drive-thru times dropping almost all of our major international markets, and notably here in the U.S. as well. So I'm going talk maybe more about that later.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">David Tarantino</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi. Good morning. And Steve, I guess, while we're on the subject of speed of service, I just wanted to ask, I guess at the opening remarks, you talked about having a philosophy of not focusing on incremental change but focusing on more step changes in your overall strategy. So, I'm just wondering, if there's something on drive-thru speed that can accelerate the progress you're seeing? It seems like it's been fairly shallow so far, but perhaps I'm mistaken on that. And then maybe one clarification at the end, I just wanted to understand the traffic growth or traffic decline in the U.S. and Q2. Did that change from what you saw in Q1 or did it remain around the same level? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Well, let me take the drive-thru one. Once a year, we get our leaders from around the world together, so probably 60, 70 strong, including the managing directors of our top 20 markets. And we got together at the start of March. And whilst clearly it's been a really strong performance across the last 3 to 4 years, there are some areas where we know we need to do better. And we kind of had a white of the eyes conversation at the start of March. And we collectively agreed that we were going to renew some emphasis on the drive-thru service times. They've been going the wrong way with most of our markets for 3 or 4 years for reasons we can understand, as we’ve added more to our business, but we knew that wasn’t a sustaining trend. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, when you talk about progress in the drive-thru, I mean, frankly, it will improve. We want to get incremental improvement week-to-week-to-week. So, each time a customer comes back, say a week or two later, they can notice a few seconds difference. There's been a ton of things we've done. We've had some centrally led initiatives but also some market dynamic. All the stuff from many some of the menu simplification moves that you would have read about, particularly here in the U.S. where we streamline the late night menu, removing of the signature crafted, which was slowing down service times, and giving some of the local co-ops a chance to roll back some of the all day breakfast rollout from the second phase.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, those things just helped smooth the operation in the kitchens. But, we’re also introducing -- increasingly introducing technology, and diagnostic tools. Our managers and crew can see in real time in the drive-thru lanes. They can basically decompose the various elements of a drive-thru visit for a customer into its constituent seconds. So, how long are we taking to take the orders? How long are we taking to take the payment? How long it takes us to gather the food and present it? How many cars are we asking to pull forward and bring the food later? And just with that attention, we’re beginning to see notable changes. So, it clearly takes off really by start of this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Just to give you a slight sense of what we're seeing already. In June, for example, in the U.S., we saw a 15-second reduction year-on-year in service times in the drive-thru, which I would say is more than incremental. I mean, that's notable. And clearly, that's rewarding for customers, it's a smoother journey. It also helps us with throughput as well. So, there's certainly a lot more to do. But, I'm really encouraged. And in certain other international markets surpassing double that type of production with the focus we’re putting on. So there's more to come.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Kevin, you may want to talk a little bit to traffic decline?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">David, regarding guest counts in the U.S. in the second quarter. I think, there wasn’t a meaningful change in the underlying guest count trend in the U.S.. The actual number for the second quarter was, I'll say, less negative than the first quarter. But, there were some specific things in the second quarter, some of which Steve mentioned earlier, things like the calendar shift with Eastern timing this year versus last year that a little bit benefited the second quarter; as Steve talked about, the Filet-O-Fish. We had about 70% of our co-ops that offered a Filet-O-Fish deal in Q2. That helped drive sales and guest count. And then Worldwide Favorites obviously was an LTO. That helped the second quarter too. So, while the actual number was less negative in the second quarter, I'd say there really hasn't been a meaningful change in the underlying trends.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeff Bernstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great. Thank you very much. Just following on that. One clarification, if you could just provide some color on the breakfast side of the business in the U.S. I got the impression last quarter that you were keen to see the breakfast had turned more favorable. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether there was any accelerating momentum in the quarter, where it stands, the percentage of sales and maybe how breakfast compares to the to the rest of the day?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then, I just wanted to ask one other thing. Should we expect, Kevin, an update on the return of cash targets as we now finish out ‘19 and we're going to get another three-year bucket as we look out through the next few years or how should we think about the outlook for that going forward? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, Jeff. I'll take the first one. We did see a better trading performance in the breakfast daypart in quarter two, the combination of local activity with a local comp support, plus we did get to see some strong results out of the McCafé initiatives and the donut sticks that would be launched in the first quarter as well. So, on the daypart, we grew sales. It was still the slowest growing daypart amongst the day, but we're back to a solid sales growth. There’s still guest count decline as I think we mentioned before, as there's been plenty of other entrants who are competing in the breakfast market, and we don't have it all our own way, the way perhaps we used to, back in the day. So, it remains competitive. We’ve got sales growth. We're encouraged by that, but we know we’ve got more work to do.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And regarding returning of cash target. So, as you know, this year, we’ll complete our three-years $25 billion target. We're on track to do that. So, we'll finish that this year. Later in the year, then, we'll provide an update as far as what that means going forward, perhaps beginning in 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">John Glass</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you just update us maybe on the U.S. franchisee relationships? In particular, I think you slowed down the EOTF rollout in concession to them. But now, you're talking about profits, for eight months rising? Is there a greater enthusiasm to embrace this maybe and pull forward some of the things you talked about in ‘21 and ‘22 and get it done faster? Can you also talk about maybe where they stand or where you stand on delivery? I think there was some friction around commissions and sort of the economics of that. Have you resolved some of those issues? And I think there were some adjustments you made -- plan to make in the back half, just what those adjustments to royalty or rent relief associated with that. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes, thanks, John. As I’ve said before, 2018 was a really hard work year. I mean, both the other operators, and the company invested a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of money in really kick starting the bigger, bolder vision, as the plan they built. And that does create tensions at a point in time, and that's natural. We worked our way through them. I would say that by easing off -- the speed of the EOTF -- those owner/operators who wanted a bit of breathing room, were able to select that and push one or two projects out which gave them a lot more confidence and comfort. That said, the results we’re getting from the EOTF rollout are really strong, and they are similar -- very similar to what we've seen elsewhere in the world. So, you’ll find, the majority of owner/operators are sticking with the original plan, the accelerated plan, really to complete their businesses by the end of 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">It will be optional for owner/operators to pull their projects forward if they want to in 2021 and 2022. They're welcome to. We'll be ready for it. I think what it has also given us is -- I mean, we're a wonderful learning organization as a system. We're always driving curious to get better. And if we look at the performance of EOTF, as an example, because you mentioned it, the downtime of the projects, we're about 2 to 4 days better this year than we were in 2018, which clearly helps get the business back on track. The time to recover the sales as in when you reopen, getting yourselves back up to the levels, that recovery time is quicker. And also, the dip during the closure is a little less this year than it was last year. So, I think our execution around these 2,000 projects this year is sharper, but probably those 3 elements, which again builds confidence in the owner/operators that this is going to be a stronger business outcome for them.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">With delivery, yes, we’re clearly keen to roll this out. The owner/operators know this is a great business opportunity. We have, around the world, with our owner/operators in each of our markets to find an arrangement with them as to how we can best take some of the heat out of the commission costs they face in order to make it encouraging. We want them to make money out of it and we, as a company, will make money as a result.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, I think we're in a far better place. I think probably the two indicators just here in the U.S. that will demonstrate the confidence the owner/operators have is that once we settled on this new rent arrangement with them, I think, it was within about a week, they voted on a national marketing campaign with Uber Eats to put marketing dollars behind delivery. And the eagerness with which they've embraced the second and third-party operator being DoorDash. I mentioned in my opening comments, we’ve got around 200 restaurants in Houston on DoorDash at the moment. And that's just really making sure we integrate the technology and get the operation right. By the end of August, we’re going to have probably two ways of around 4,000-plus restaurants. So, we’ll be up at about 9,000 on DoorDash by the end of August, again, just showing you the speed we're going, and hence the owner/operator commitment behind it. And we've got already about 9,000 with our kind of our key strategic partners as Uber Eats. There's no perfect crossover. There’s going be about an additional 1,200 restaurants that have either one or other depending on coverage. That means, there is about 8,000, which we’ll have two third-party operators. And yes, we've seen around the world that gives us good incremental delivery business.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Customers are typically, not solely, but typically are loyal to one third-party operator app. So, we know what we're seeing from Canada when we added SkipTheDishes to the Uber Eats platform. We’ve also seen elsewhere around the world, such as in Italy where we’ve got three, where we’ve got Glovo, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. So, we’ve got good experience of work in multiple delivery partners and we're confident the incrementally will come with it, and then, as a result, the cash flow to the operators. But ultimately, the mood of the operators, I think are feeling much more confident. By May of this year, their cash flow growth eclipsed the decline that they saw in 2018. So, as you can imagine, that gives people a great sense of satisfaction. June continued that. So, we now have 8 months in a row of cash flow growth. And they're confident and committed to maintaining that such trend forward, because they’ve committed a lot to this plan, they committed a lot to our business and we want them to build business growth and success.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Greg Francfort</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks for the question. Just maybe going back to the drive-thru times, can you quantify how much those were up? And then, I guess, the question is, how much have you recaptured with the 15-second, and what percentage of what you have seen in increased in the last few years? And then, how much opportunity do you think there is going forward? And what's the key strategy to address as that as there are changes you have to make on the product front or menu front to kind of capture more time savings? Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. I wouldn’t get into all the details of drive-thru service. They do differ by country as well, obviously, depending on how busy the drive-thrus are. I mean, we've got certain markets in Europe where drive-thru is only about 40% of the business of a drive-thru restaurant whereas here in the U.S., it can be upwards of 70% to 75%. So, that creates a totally different service time dynamic. I would say, across the major markets. As we sat down in March, we wanted to set ourselves abundantly to be about 30 seconds better, which we knew would be notable, and not to be notable to the customer and also then business enhancing as this eases up throughput, particularly in those peak service times. Obviously, that's the most critical time to do it.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">There's a number of different initiatives to it. I mean, some of it is just getting the focus, I mean, understandably with the aggressive rollout of Experience of the Future. There was a heightened focus in store, front counter dining area, we’re just rebalancing that. So it's just the focus on the drive-thru, people positioning, making sure we’re starting right training and the basics. But, there are certain things for example, on menu, and I think we've got a far more forensic ability through our global operations team and our innovation center now to analyze the complexity of our menus by market and identify those slower-moving items that really are not contributing much to incremental margin and certainly not selling in many volumes, but great barriers to service.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, those diagnostic tools and forensic tools we have now is providing the information into each of the markets, they can make smart menu decisions. But it's not just about the menus around technology as well, and actually just making it fun. I mean, we've had a number of service competitions around all the markets. And particularly now we're getting these tools to the restaurants, to the managers. When I first saw this, the drive-thrus timer tools in Canada probably 12 to 18 months ago and then saw them rolled out in Europe probably about 12 months ago. There is a majority in the U.S. drive-thrus now. Probably what captured my attention among anything else was the enthusiasm the managers and the crew had to that kind of local competition, how are you doing most of the drive-thrus in your area, drive-thrus in your owner/operator group, or the drive-thrus that have similar volume to you. So, we can use these tools in many ways to A, identify where the barriers are but actually just make it fun, incentivize and getting enthusiasm in management and crew. So, more to come. I'm encouraged with where we’re at. We’ve some markets which are actually 30, 40 seconds quicker now just three or four months in. So, they've got a bigger opportunity than some but they're making good headway. And the U.S., I'm proud of where the U.S. is at. I know they're focused on getting better than the 50. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Dennis Geiger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks for the questions. I wanted just to ask a bit more about the U.S. guest counts. Maybe if you could just highlight a bit more where you're seeing progress and where the biggest opportunities are to continue to show that improvement? And then I guess within that context, Steve, I think you've talked in the past about a growth strategy to retain customers, regain customers and convert casual customers. Any update there you could give, specifically on the converting the casual customer, and if that's still how you're thinking about getting that discount up in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Dennis, it's Kevin. I'll take a stab at that and Steve can chime in. As far as progress or opportunity, I think, as we've talked about, certainly one of our biggest opportunities continues to be at breakfast. As Steve talked about, there's been a lot of new entrants into that space. So, there's not many players that are growing, comp guest count at breakfast, or really in most of the dayparts. But new entrants have kind of caused a scattering, I'll say, of the existing guest counts among just more units.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As far as retain, regain convert, the convert strategy for us was always around kind of opportunities in either other dayparts or other areas that we didn't have our fair share, if you will. So areas like coffee and snacking and areas that are potential further growth opportunities, but we're not as strong in some of those areas. It wasn't necessarily taking some of our existing customers and just having them come more frequently. So, there still are opportunities in some of those areas, again, like coffee and like snacking.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">I think, the way, we think about it is, there's an opportunity, and this is what kind of one of the purposes of both EOTF and our digital is to take our existing relationship with customers, and expand that relationship through digital means, whether that's through apps, further loyalty program at some point. But, the whole customer relationship where we can get to know and personalize offers easier and better for existing customers. That's one of our big opportunities.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The U.S. guest counts will continue to be a, we call it a street fight just because it's a very competitive environment here in the U.S. But, I think, there is more of a focus on what do we need to do in the various dayparts. Again, breakfast probably being the biggest opportunity for us to regain some of those guest counts that we lost. And it really is about, we call it losing guest count, but it's not losing customers, it's losing customer visits. So, it's customers that may not be visiting us as often as they were historically. And if we can regain some of those additional visits, especially a breakfast time, which is, as you know, a very habitual ritual. And so, if we can get those customers coming again at breakfast, it would be a huge benefit.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Just to support Kevin's comments, particularly around the, if you like, the technology ecosystem we're building here. For us to have a personalized relationship with our customers, which I think will be valuable to us and also make it valuable to them, we've got to find ways for them to identify themselves, when they enter the drive-through, without slowing the drive-through process down, identify themselves at the self order kiosk. And again, even though this is less pressure on time there, you don't want it to slow them down. Or for example, if they're having home delivery, and when we get some route delivery through the McDonald’s app and we're working with our partner of Uber Eats, we're going to be getting the ability to route those orders through the McDonald’s app. Once we can start a link, a drive-through transactions, to in-store transactions to home delivery, we started to build a really good picture of our customers and eventually person-by-person. I think that will be incredibly valuable for us to make ourselves more relevant and more interesting to those customers. And from customer perspective, just make the experience smoother and more enjoyable.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, you'd expect to hear more, there are certainly some initiatives we’ve been working on the markets right now on those. Nothing to say at scale yet, but I can assure you the culture of innovation that we've got going here is playing out. We've got a number of initiatives in number of our markets, we're learning very, very quickly how best to identify customers or customers to choose by themselves is a better way of saying it, at drive-thru and the in-store, we believe we've got the home delivery piece already initiated. I'm really excited about what they could offer to business.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Jon Tower</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great, thanks. I just wanted to talk quickly on the unit growth. I think today, you bumped up your expectations for 2019 to 800 stores net. And over the past two years, you've seen a nice jump in absolute net numbers. So, can you discuss whether or not you expect this type of net openings to persist in the future? What's fueling this growth or franchisees in new markets, seeing better returns than in the past? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Couple of things. First, related to the I'll call it change, slight change in guidance in the outlook section of the release. Really, what's driving that net additions number of about 50 higher than it was last quarter is less closings. So, our gross openings number for this year will be similar to what we thought it was going to be, but the closings that we originally anticipated, beginning the year a little bit lower. And about half of those are in our Developmental Licensed markets and about half of them are in the International Operated markets, half of the change in closing that is. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">As far as how we think about unit growth, there's still a lot of potential, even in our mature markets. So, markets like Canada, France, Italy, Spain, have a lot of opportunity to continue growing new units, and the U.S. even long-term we believe.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Now, what's helpful in the way we've changed our business model is what you actually see is right now substantially, the large portion of openings are in our Developmental Licensed markets, China and the other DL markets, which use their capital. So, it’s a pretty efficient way for us to grow. So, you should expect to see continued growth in new units, again, both in the DL markets by our partners, as well as in our more mature markets that we own, like the ones I just spoke about.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Just to add on to that. I just want to give a shout out to some of the mid-size operated markets. Recently I've been in Italy, Poland, Netherlands, I mean, these markets are doing double-digit sales comps on top of double-digit sales comps. And hence, that’s creating clearly significant increase in volumes and throughput of restaurants and putting some capacity pressure on. So, I’d tell you, desire in the market is to sort of pick up the openings a little bit. I'm heading out to Russia in about two months time to spend some time there with the team. And again with a strong growth at both guest counts and sales they are seeing, I know they have an ambition for growth. And if you remember, we previously called that segment the high growth segment, and that was because we expected them to grow units at a greater pace than the perhaps the more mature market. So, we're keeping a real close eye on it. And the stronger we grow the business, then the stronger the confidence level is to grow the units as well. So, more to come by the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Bittner</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Can you guys talk a little bit more about your store level margins in the United States? It's the first time, they've expanded in five quarters, and certainly were much healthier level than all of us analysts were forecasting. I know you said refranchising with the positive impact, Kevin, but I think probably a similar impact, as you've seen in recent quarters. So, are the franchisees seeing a similar margin trend change this quarter? And if so, what drove that? And then just following up on the EOTF. Can you tell us what the net impact you believe EOTF was on comps this quarter and how you expect that to change into the second half? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Let me start with the store level margins. And I guess, I'll talk about company operated margins, because obviously, we have -- those are our restaurants. So, I can see a lot of detail related to those. I think, one of the big differences is -- certainly comps in the second quarter were higher than they were, let's say in the first quarter. And obviously higher comps definitely help that. But the other thing I'd say is there's a little bit more stability in the restaurants in 2019 than 2018. Steve talked earlier about kind of the hard work and all the things that we threw at the restaurant in 2018, including EOTF, a lot of projects, fresh beef, the restructure we did in the field, all those changes that kind of impacted the restaurants. And so, kind of as we've now kind of I’ll say stabilize the business a little bit, and just have less overall initiative deployment, as well as slowing the pace or getting near the end of kind of our refranchising, the restaurants are now able to just focus on running the restaurants as efficiently as possible. So, we saw kind of more efficiency in labor productivity in the second quarter than we've seen in the -- than we saw in the first quarter and last year.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">On the franchisees side, we've talked about their cash flow is up. So, their unit level economics have been doing well, similarly. So, I think that's probably the biggest change as far as what we're seeing in margin versus last year, certainly.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Related to EOTF, I'd say the benefit in the second quarter was a little higher than it was in the first quarter, and we would expect that to be relatively similar for the remaining quarters of this year. As we said, we completed about a 1,000 projects this year, but as you -- so far this year of our 2,000 that will complete in total. But that's coming off of finishing about 4,500 last year. So, we have a big base of projects that are now complete that we're seeing the benefit of, in addition to kind of improvement in how we're doing those projects, as Steve talked about less downtime, quicker recovery, et cetera. So, we expect those EOTF benefits to continue. And obviously, as we have completed more projects, that certainly helps future results.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">As we near the top of the hour, we'll take one final question from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sara Senatore</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I just have two quick follow-ups, if I may. The first was on the EOTF and traffic in the U.S. I had been in the impression that last year, part of the issue was during the store closures you lost some traffic. And I would have thought maybe you'd have gotten that back this year. But, it sounds sort of like, you haven't gotten the traffic back so much as the customers that are still going to McDonald’s are just spending more and EOTF is supporting that. I just wanted to understand the dynamics there between like -- and lapping the closures? And then just on China, are you seeing any cannibalization? We've noticed across the board a lot of restaurants taking up unit growth in China and seeing their comp decelerate accordingly. Is that something that you have to contemplate, or are you still so underpenetrated, it's not really an issue there.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I can start with EOTF. Related to EOTF. So, last year, as you mentioned, we had restaurants closed, the ones that needed to be -- primarily the ones that had the big projects what we call non-modernized, so the ones where we needed to do a remodel plus the EOTF components. This year, while there's less number of projects being done, there are a higher percentage of those non-mods being done. And so, while we've gotten better at reducing the amount of time that they're closed, we still have some of those closures. Now, that isn't the only issue obviously related to traffic though. Again, to be fair, we were losing traffic before we started the EOTF, and that won't fix all the issues related to traffic. So, the traffic piece is beyond just EOTF. And as we've gotten better and done more of these EOTF projects, we're getting better at completing those. But that in and of itself won't resolve all of the traffic issues.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Steve Easterbrook</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Just to pick up on the China question, Sara. We had really strong system-wide sales growth in China for the quarter. Clearly, we've got a rapid pace of expansion of new restaurant openings, but we also grew sales and grew guest count in the quarter as well. So core business is robust. And I would say probably exceeding the opening plans that we've initially expected. I mean, if you look at the five-year period ending 2022, our partners are looking to exceed more than 2,000 openings that are certainly on track at the moment. And having called out recently, there are -- been very confident moving out of the same level of business. I mean, it's incredibly competitive. You've seen the pace at which other people are expanding. But it is a huge market. The emerging middle class, there's a greater affordability of the mass population there is heading towards Western QSR type of average checks and affordability. So, it's certainly a market we're excited about, we’re very confident about the long-term future there, and really pleased with the way the partners are working out as well. They're doing terrific job. So, it'll be more than 400 openings this year after about 400 plus last year as well. And if they can keep the sales comps going at the same time, then, clearly, that indicates a healthy position for the business.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Mike Cieplak</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Okay.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck &amp; Company Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I would now like to turn the call over to Teri Loxam, SVP, Investor Relations and Global Communications. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Teri Loxam</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Darla and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2019 conference call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Labs, who will read our prepared remarks. In addition, I'm also joined by Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will be available for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before I turn the call over to Ken, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation of these in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2018 10-K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. You can see our SEC filings, as well as today's earnings release on merck.com. We have also posted a presentation to the investor section of merck.com which includes some of our highlights from the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Kenneth Frazier</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Teri. Good morning and thank you all for joining the call. Our science-led strategy together with our clinical and commercial execution drove another quarter of accelerating revenue growth with strength across our global portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Our results demonstrate the continued momentum of our business through the first half of the year and further show that our focus on the kind of innovation that significantly improved health outcomes is paying off.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As highlighted at our recent Investor Day, we are confident that our innovative portfolio of product and significant pipeline opportunities supported by unparalleled R&amp;D and commercial execution will continue to drive strong growth while we invest in cutting edge science to deliver breakthroughs over the next decade and beyond.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Over the past quarter, we continue to advance our pipeline and presented encouraging data across our programs, including two additional regulatory approvals and a filing acceptance for KEYTRUDA. Two new regulatory approvals in infectious diseases, as well as new clinical data on the V14 - V114 pediatrics trial, MK-8591 and many others.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our clinical and regulatory progress reflects Merck's unwavering commitment to biomedical research aimed at bringing forward products that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In addition, we continue to strategically invest in business development to strengthen our pipeline through value enhancing external opportunities. This quarter alone, we announced two acquisitions that will bolster our oncology pipeline with Peloton Therapeutics and Tilos Therapeutics respectively.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also successfully completed our tender offer for Immune Design and closed on the acquisition of Antelliq and animal health. We remain confident that our strategy, growth prospects, outstanding scientific and commercial talent and leadership team, together with our focus on execution will enable us to drive significant value for patients and shareholders this year and for years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rob to review the details of our quarterly performance. Rob?</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Robert Davis</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thanks, Ken. And good morning, everyone. As Ken mentioned, our performance in the second quarter is a clear testament to the strong momentum and growth potential of our business. Our result over the last several quarters continue to reinforce the confidence we have and our ability to drive sustained long-term revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion, while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused both on investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now turning to our results. Total company revenues were $11.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year or 15% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. This growth was led by our Human Health business which increased 17% this quarter excluding exchange. Animal Health grew 9% excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will all be on an ex-exchange basis.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The increase in Human Health revenues was led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales exceeded $2.6 billion this quarter, an increase of 63% year-over-year. Growth was driven by increased adoption globally in the first-line lung setting, as well as uptake in recently approved indications.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the US, strong demand across all indications continues to drive performance. KEYTRUDA is firmly established as the standard of care for indicated patients in first-line lung and we continue to further penetrate segments of the population, including low and non PD-L1 expressing patients.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In addition, we are encouraged by our recent launches in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and adjuvant melanoma where we are already seeing strong adoption by oncologists.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're also excited about our opportunity in first-line head and neck cancer for which we received approval in June. With 20 indications currently approved in the United States we are further establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational cancer treatment. Outside the US, KEYTRUDA sales grew 73% driven by long as we continue to gain reimbursement for the chemo combo in more countries in the EU.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In Japan, we are now the leading anti PD-1 agents, which speaks to our execution and the breadth of our indications. And in China, we have seen very strong growth given the recent launch in first-line lung and continued uptake in melanoma and our growth should continue as we reach more patients and expect to launch additional indications.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">KEYTRUDA is changing the way in which cancer is being treated and we are still in the early days of the KEYTRUDA journey. We remain very confident in the long-term growth potential, given our established IO leadership and our expectation for many additional approvals around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our results also reflect continued strength in both Lynparza and Lenvima, products we market in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Eisai respectively. Lynparza revenue more than doubled this quarter driven by further uptake in ovarian cancer based on the results of SOLO-1 in the United States, as well as strength in Europe, China and Japan.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Lynparza continues to lead the PARP inhibitor class in the United States, with nearly 60% total patient share. We look to further establish Lynparza as the PARP inhibitor of choice in additional tumor types and in combination with KEYTRUDA.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Lenvima revenue also more than doubled as we continue to drive sales in HCC in the United States in China and launch in several other markets. We believe the Lenvima will be an important product for our oncology portfolio and look forward to the potential for additional indications, across our broad development program.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to vaccines. Our vaccines business reflect strong growth in our pediatric portfolio, as well as strength in GARDASIL which was driven by public sector purchases and greater demand in the adolescent cohorts in the United States, as well as continued demand across Europe and the emerging markets, especially China.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our hospital business benefited from 20% growth in BRIDION which is annualizing at over $1 billion, reflecting strong performance in the United States as we continue to increase share within the reversal market.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Animal Health revenue increased 9% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 13% primarily due to the contributions from the products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales grew 4%, as volume growth in vaccines and insulin products were partially offset by the timing of customer purchases in the prior year for BRAVECTO.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to the rest of our P&amp;L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.4% in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Recall that the sizable catch-up adjustment for an accrued sales milestone related to Adempas was included in the second quarter of 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Operating expenses of $4.8 billion increased 9% year-over-year. R&amp;D drove a large portion of the increase in spend and reflects higher expenses in support of our discovery in clinical development efforts, as well as business development transactions during the quarter. SG&amp;A also grew year-over-year, reflecting continued investments to accelerate our key growth drivers and the launch of new indications.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The decrease in other income this quarter reflected the unfavorable year-on-year impact of mark-to-market income on equity securities, as well as higher net interest expense.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Taken together, we earned $1.30 per share, an increase of 25% excluding exchange. This growth demonstrates the continued momentum in our business as we drive strong top line growth combined with disciplined resource allocation enabling operational leverage.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to our outlook for the year. Given the confidence we have in our strong continued performance we are narrowing and raising both our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges for the full year of 2019. We now expect revenues of $45.2 billion to $46.2 billion, which represents 7% to 9% growth versus 2018 driven by strength across our key growth pillars.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">This range assumes a negative impact from foreign exchange of just over 1 percentage point using mid July rates. We expect OpEx to increase by mid-single digits, primarily driven by investments in R&amp;D. We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.84 to $4.94, which represents growth of approximately 12% to 14% versus 2018. We now expect a slightly negative impact from foreign exchange. All other elements of our guidance provided in April remain unchanged.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In summary, we are operating from a position of strength as reflected in our second quarter results and our updated guidance. We are confident in our ability to drive strong revenue growth in the near and long term, and we remain committed to delivering a leveraged P&amp;L, while balancing the need to invest in innovation, all of which we expect will deliver significant and sustainable value to patients and our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Roger Perlmutter</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thanks, Rob. The second quarter was a very important one for Merck Research Laboratories with meaningful progress made in every part of our organization. First, we received numerous approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration, including as previously mentioned supplementary approval for the use of KEYTRUDA both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, head neck, and supplementary approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for third-line treatment of small cell lung cancer.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We also received supplementary approval for ZERBAXA in the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by sensitive bacterial strain. This represents an important advance in the treatment of a life-threatening illness especially when caused by for example resistant pseudomonas species.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">More recently we obtained approval of RECARBRIO, our combined independent cilastatin, relebactam therapy for complicated urinary tract or intra-abdominal infections.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Relebactam was specifically engineered to enable extended activity of imipenem against certain otherwise resistant bacterial species expressing the form of beta-lactamase, and as part of our efforts to address the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">During the second quarter, we also had the opportunity to review exciting new data from our anti-retroviral program including 48 week data from the combination of Doravirine with our new nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir for the maintenance of low-viral burdens and patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">These data which were presented last week at the International AIDS Society meetings in Mexico City were complemented by studies of a subcutaneous islatravir implant that might permit long term perhaps once a yearly prophylaxis against HIV infection.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the infectious disease space, we also presented data on the immunogenicity [ph] of V114, our new 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pediatric populations. We are very enthusiastic about the V114 for which Phase 3 data from our comprehensive development program will become available beginning towards the end of this year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Returning to the oncology space, just yesterday we announced that the data monitoring committee supervising our KEYNOTE-522 Phase 3 studies of neoadjuvant and adjuvant KEYTRUDA combined with chemotherapy found that KEYTRUDA treatment was associated with an improvement in pathologic complete response rates, one of two dual primary endpoints of this study as compared with chemotherapy alone.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">I wish to make two key points regarding this study. First, neoadjuvant therapy occupies an increasingly important role in the treatment of breast cancer, especially in the triple-negative subset, which represents between 15% and 20% of breast cancers. In this setting, the use of neoadjuvant therapy can reduce tumor burden from a less aggressive surgical resection and provide improvement in long-term outcomes.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Second, achievement of a pathological complete response in which examination of the surgical specimens shows the tumor cells have been eliminated has been repeatedly associated with improved of event-free survival and overall survival and is often quite aggressive malignancies. Hence we are very encouraged by the interim analysis demonstrating successful achievement of this endpoint.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In this context, the KEYNOTE-522 data monitoring committee recommended that the study continue unchanged. And so the data become mature enough to assess event free survival. In the meantime, we look forward to discussing the KEYNOTE-522 data with regulatory authorities and to presenting our data in an upcoming scientific meeting.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Finally, I wish to notice that we anticipate risk pace of regulatory approvals in major jurisdictions that we have achieved during the first six months of the year will continue, especially in the oncology space. I look forward to sharing these notifications with you in due course.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, my colleagues and I will take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Teri Loxam</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks, Roger. Darla, we'll turn it over to the Q&amp;A portion. And I'd like to remind everyone if they can keep their questions to a maximum of two to allow as many questions on the call as possible.</p>, <p class=""p p5"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Terence Flynn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, there's obviously been a more significant focus on larger deals in this space following some of the recent announcements. I would just welcome your latest thoughts here on Merck's capital allocation strategy. I know you touched on this a little bit at your Investor Day about a month ago, but just wondering if you could provide us an update there. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kenneth Frazier</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you very much for the question, Terence. We have launched some of the activity around us in the sector. I think each one of those companies is evaluating their own growth prospects over the next few years. We feel very, very confident in our growth prospects going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As we have said in the past, given all of that, we are not interested particularly in a large merger that we believe could be disruptive to the company, including R&amp;D. We continue to look at bolt-on deals. We do look across the spectrum in terms of size for bolt-on, we don't divide it by $1 amount. But at the end of the day, we think the operational complexity, the cultural disruption, the R&amp;D disruption, that has been associated with large mergers counsel that we should not go there, particularly, because we feel very confident about our ability to grow our company organically supplemented by bolt-on deals.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Great. Thank you. We'll take the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">It's from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Seamus Fernandez</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks very much for the question. So maybe just two very quickly. On the first one, some spectacular growth in the pediatric vaccines across the board, as well as GARDASIL, could you guys just help us more fully understand the sustainability of the kind of growth that we saw this quarter. And then, and just incremental to that, if you could just comment on what happened with NuvaRing this quarter in particular?</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And then the second question, just broadly speaking for Roger, 8591, the data looks solid for the doravirine combination. Obviously the PrEP information is quite impressive and exciting, particularly if you can get to annual dosing with the implants. But just wanted to better understand how you guys are working towards finding a better partner than doravirine for 8591. And if you're willing to work with other companies and collaborate on those programs.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">That was -- those were some concerns raised by physicians that other great products are out there and that unfortunately it doesn't look like the companies are collaborating with each other on that front. So I just wanted to ask on that front. Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Great. Thanks, Seamus. We'll start with Frank.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Sure, Seamus. So let me start first with NuvaRing. No really new news there, no generic entry this quarter. Seamus, so we continue to promote NuvaRing as we have done in the past. With regards to vaccines, a couple of things.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let me start with GARDASIL. GARDASIL had a very strong quarter growth of 50% if you were to exclude exchange on a global basis. We did see in the US, we did see CDC purchases in Q2 of this year, which actually took place in Q1 of last year. So, you do see some bumpiness with some of our vaccine sales. But I would ask them to take a look at Seamus, on a year-to-date basis vaccines for GARDASIL globally is up about 35%.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So we're seeing very strong demand expressing 11 year to 12 year-old cohorts in the US and some in the 19 to 26 cohorts. We're also seeing very strong ex-US demand as we talked about our Investor Day in particular in China, in Europe and a lot of the general neutral programs are rolling out. So we're still very confident in our growth prospects for GARDASIL.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The pediatric vaccines did also see a very strong quarter, this quarter. That was driven by demand as well. There was some buoyant to the private sector within the US. This quarter based on some of the Measles outbreaks that you've read in the news and we do believe that we'll continue to see growth for our pediatric vaccines going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So the durability of our vaccine business, we feel very good about both for near term and long term growth as we mentioned just on Investor Day.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">All right. Seamus, this is Roger. With regard to islatravir MK-8591, I mean, first of all, I would say, again, the performance of islatravir is quite remarkable and especially in the implant setting the durability is remarkable. And it's important to note that the very long intracellular half life of islatravir and the very impressive resistance profile.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">I would take nothing away from doravirine in terms of its capabilities for many in the market that used the previous non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, in particular, which had a lot of adverse events associated with them. Doravirine is superior to those and is a very effective agent. And I think the combination of islatravir, doravirine will be good.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">That said, we are also considering a lots of other combinations and lots of other conversations. And over time you will have the opportunity to see the broader impact of islatravir in a variety of different settings.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The important thing to emphasize is, it can be administered on a daily, weekly or monthly or even a longer duration regimen, which offers great possibilities. I think for change in treatment patterns in HIV infected individuals. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks. We'll take the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">It's from Andrew Baum with Citi.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Baum</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Firstly interested in your thoughts on the tenant proposal to fund catastrophic coverage given your exposure to Lenvima, Lynparza, Januvia and others.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Second on, islatravir, question for Roger, thinking about PrEP, both with the implants as well as the once-monthly, do you think the FDA is ready to accept anything other than traditional non-inferiority trials or what do you think that could do to the timelines in order to bringing islatravir to market as PrEP? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kenneth Frazier</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Okay. So let me just comment generally about what's happening with the various things that are going on and some of these proposals that were included in the Senate finance package.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let me start by saying that as a company, we are very supportive. The kinds of changes that will relieve patients in terms of their out-of-pocket costs. I think the catastrophic changes are step in the right direction, but that's a very small number of people who actually progress through the system and get the catastrophic.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So we continue to work with people as part of the legislative process and the administration, because we support lowering costs for seniors at the counter and not just at the catastrophic portion and so with respect to the impact on our own portfolio. I'm going to turn it over to Frank.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah. So just on the oncology front, I think you heard from our colleague at AstraZeneca, Lynparza for Part D is, approximately 25% of our business flows through Part D.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">To remind everyone with regards to KEYTRUDA, that is reimbursed through Part B. So it is not a Part D product. So we feel as though we're balanced across our oncology portfolio going forward. Roger?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah. And Andrew with respect to PrEP regimens. I think it's a great concern to the community as a whole that if one has to do active comparator controls, because of [indiscernible] that's understandable. The event rates are so low that you will need very, very large populations and very difficult to execute clinical trials.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">FDA and other regulatory agencies are not aware of this. There have been discussions among a variety of sponsors and particularly in the very active patient community about this and what could be done.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And we have a lot of ideas in mind that thus far, we don't really have a novel trial design that would permit more rapid registration, watch this space, I mean, we're very concerned about decision.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks. We'll move on to the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Chris Schott</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first elaborate a little bit more on the China dynamics that are driving that 51% growth. I guess what products in particular behind this and can you just remind us the overall size of your China business at this point?</p>, <p class=""p p7"">My second question was just KEYTRUDA in RCC, could we just get a quick update in terms of - uptake you're seeing so far. Where in the market you're seeming to get the most traction with the data, et cetera. Just, I know it's obviously an important new indication for you guys. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, Chris. It's Frank on China. And China is about $725 million this quarter and it grew to 0.50%, really being driven by a number of products. As we mentioned we have pivoted to innovation. So our oncology portfolio, Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA is driving the growth.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">GARDASIL has had a significant uptake in China. We have NRDL listing also for Januvia. So it's a broad base innovative portfolio that is driving that 50% growth and we believe that will continue in China. With regards to RCC we're very excited, Chris about where we are to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As we mentioned when we rolled out the data for RCC, it's important to note that KEYTRUDA plus axitinib shows a benefit across all three risk groups, which differentiates us from the competition. So we are seeing uptake across all three risk groups and it's really based on the strong overall survival, progression-free survival and very strong response rates.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">80% of our chartered accounts in the US have adopted this regimen into their guidelines, which I think is a very strong early indicator. And we're seeing and hearing very strong feedback from both community and academic physicians.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So I feel really good Chris about RCC in the US. And as you know, we also plan to be rolling that out around the world. So we see this as a key indication, key growth drivers for us going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Great. And Roger, on 522? My bad, sorry. I thought - I missed out the question, apologies. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">It's from Navin Jacob with UBS.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Navin Jacob</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, thanks for taking the question. Two, sorry if I missed this. But, would it be possible to quantify how much of the US GARDASIL public sector buying pattern was if you could actually quantify, that amount that would be helpful.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then just on KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza and first-line lung, could you remind us where those trials are when we could expect to see readouts there. And as a corollary to that KEYTRUDA in prostate cancer, you're going to be starting a three Phase 3 trials there as well. I'm wondering when we could hear updates from those trials as well. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">We'll start with Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Right, okay. So as we have discussed and we've showed some data from our Investor Day, this is quite a large opportunity for combinations KEYTRUDA with Lynparza and in one of those cases, it's prostate cancer. We have indicated that we will study registration enabling studies for those. And US as we're starting to move forward obviously they take some time to conduct, we'll then have a chance to update you on the results.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But we are enthusiastic about the opportunity of the combination and believe that there will be many circumstances. I should point out that not only, the Lynparza combination, but the Lenvima combination as well - we're, we just received breakthrough designation for the hepatocellular carcinoma first-line indication 2. So there is an awful lot going on in combination studies with both agents.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yeah. And on GARDASIL as I mentioned, we had a CDC purchase in Q2 which was not purchased in Q2 of 2018. It was actually purchased in Q1 of '18. So the way in which I would characterize GARDASIL is in the US, year-to-date we have grown 20%, when you look on a six month basis.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I think that's the best way to look at it from a GARDASIL perspective. So think of the US growing about 20% right now versus prior year for the half year mark, because you are going to see different timing with regards to the CDC purchases.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Frank. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">It's from Umer Raffat with Evercore.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Umer Raffat</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I had two if I may. First can you mentioned low complexity as being a key consideration for bolt-ons, you're looking at. And in that vein, I guess my question is, are you open to therapeutic areas like orphan and also if there is a company with let's say $50 billion market cap or value, is that still a tuck-in, as long as the complexity is low?</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And secondly on gross margin, so I see two big drivers going forward. One, of course, being KEYTRUDA's Bristol-Myers royalty reduction in 2023. But also anything you may be baking in on pricing reform. I was curious if you could add numbers around each of those. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Kenneth Frazier</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">So I'll start with the PD question. Thanks, Umer for your questions. I don't think the size is the issue necessarily for complexity. I think it has to do with whether or not the two companies overlap and whether or not we are spending a lot of our time integrating IT systems manufacturing systems.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So if it's a true add-on, a separate kind of business, a true both-on, then I don't think that the size drives the complexity at all. As it relates to orphan versus other types, our preference is to do the most good for the most people.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But having said that, we are not against the right kind of therapy, even including orphan indications or orphan approaches to therapy. What we care about is are we getting good science that we can leverage together with our internal efforts to actually create value for our shareholders as well as patients.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Good morning, Umer. This is Rob. To your question, just to remind everyone, for gross margin, over time, as we indicated at the Investor Day, we do expect to see gross margin generally flat, because while we do see product mix benefits flowing from products like KEYTRUDA and our vaccines business, we also, as we mentioned have assumed negative price going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">The impact of royalties, you've had, obviously, the one with KEYTRUDA that does step down in 2023 and the impact of the collaborations, which in the near-term will be a drag on margin or the long term, they become accretive.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">We haven't given specific dollar numbers to those. And frankly, we don't want to give that specific guidance, but clearly how those interplay will determine whether you see our product gross margin slightly up, slightly down or flat over the period with most of what's driving our operating margin expansion, as we've talked about coming from reducing growth in operating expense relative to sales.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Rob. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">It's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Risinger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Thanks very much. I guess first I'd like to start with, actually the last comment and I know that this was mentioned previously, at the analyst meeting. But in terms of Merck's projection of negative price going forward that's a bit different than some of your peers. I think for some of your peers, talk about flat pricing, so maybe you could provide some more color regarding what you see as the biggest downward pressures on price for Merck going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then second, could you just provide an update on the - growing meningitis concerns. I jumped on the call late, so I don't know if this is addressed, but wanted to hear about that topic. And then also the durability of Merck's PROQUAD MMR-II revenue line strength. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. We'll start with Rob.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Davis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">And morning, David. So thanks for the question. With regard to the pricing, again, I think the important thing to focus on is, how we see the mix going forward. And I can't speak to what our competitors are implying that, recall we've actually seen negative price quite some time outside the United States.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So that's not a new phenomenon. We've been absorbing headwinds and price outside the United States for several years. Historically that was offset by price increases in the United States.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">As we look going forward, we no longer see the benefit of those price increases in the United States because of obviously the changing dynamics. And so as you look in total, we do continue to believe we're going to see declining price as we look forward, impacting our margins.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks. And Frank on the pediatric vaccines.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. So on the pediatric vaccines, we are continuing to see very good demand within the pediatric vaccines. And clearly the measles outbreak has driven some of that demand expression in the private sector. We also did see buy-in this quarter in Q2. We do anticipate that some of that buy-in will come out in Q3 and Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">But as I mentioned before, we see our pediatric vaccine business as a very strong part of our growth story. And we see it as a very durable business going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks. We'll take the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">It's from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Tim Anderson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. A couple of questions. A longer-term question on KEYTRUDA, we published an analysis while back claiming that cancer drugs, very often ultimately sell much more outside the US and in the US as they mature to the tune of 50% more or so, when I look at how we and the analyst community at large models KEYTRUDA and other PD1s for that matter. No one ever really seem to have ex-US even surpassing the US.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And I'm wondering if you can tell us what your long-term model assumes from this regard, could ex-US markets eventually kind of blow away, the US market over time. It could be billions of dollars more potentially.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Second question, Bristol recently top-lined part 1 of 227 as positive, which I think was a surprise. Can you remind us where you are with your CTLA-4 combination program specifically what are the latest stage trials and then what tumor types. I guess as you may have kind of backed off this initiative that you started maybe a couple of years ago? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So let's start with Frank on KEYTRUDA.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. So for the KEYTRUDA as we look long term, we do see significant opportunity outside the US in particular markets like China, especially when you look at some of the GI malignancies in the actual prevalence there. We are seeing obviously very strong uptake in Japan as well, not going to give a specific number, but we clearly do see ex-US opportunity is very significant in fact this quarter alone, we sold $1.1 billion outside the US and grew 73%. So we see both ex-US and US KEYTRUDA opportunities. But clearly, China is the one I would highlight as significant potential growth for us going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And Roger?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And Tim, with respect to CTLA-4 directed therapy, our interest has been in demonstrating or assessing whether or not adding CTLA-4 directed therapy actually has an impact over KEYTRUDA alone, that is powering the study to see whether CTLA-4 plus KEYTRUDA is in fact superior to KEYTRUDA in any setting and we have done that both with adalimumab and also with MK-1308, our own CTLA-4 directed therapy.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And so registration enabling studies are going on in both setting and with both kinds of combinations, which includes, for example, the KEYNOTE-598 study and a couple of others, and we could go through the details with you, I think, find them usually on clinicaltrials.gov.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">We'll move on to the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">It's from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gerberry</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, just a follow-up on the Bristol Opdivo, Yervoy data, just curious, Roger, how do you think oncologists are going to benchmark the CheckMate-227 data against the already approved either Merck combination or KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the PD-L1 greater than 1% populations?</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then my second question maybe just for Frank, can you frame the importance of NRDL listing for KEYTRUDA in the lung setting? And what I'm specifically curious about is the percent of the market accessible with and without the listing? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">We'll start with Roger.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, Jason. It's pretty hard to comment on the data from the CheckMate-227 program, because we haven't actually seen it. We have the top line announcement that one part of it was in the PD-L1 greater than 1% did succeed in the combination with adalimumab, but we don't know what that success looked like in overall survival. We don't know the hazard ratios look like and there is a - it's complicated study as you appreciate because the study was broken down into most parts and a part of it was predicated on a tumor mutational burden analysis and then subsequent PD-L1 directed such that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So we're not actually seeing the data, pretty hard to know how oncologists will respond with time, the data will become available. And I think people will want to have a look at it and understand what the meaning of that might be.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I think our own data, I think are extremely strong of course, with KEYTRUDA and the combination of KEYTRUDA plus traditional chemotherapy with typically on the order of a doubling of overall survival.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So there is an important value that can be gained there and we are optimistic that we're going to continue to be able to advance therapies that will improve overall survival of this disease.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, Roger. Will go to Frank on the NRDL.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. And just one additional pointed to what Roger was saying commercially with regards to lung, I do believe we're in a very strong position with our data. And as you mentioned with monotherapy on the PD-L1 high population with very strong overall survival as well as KEYNOTE-189 reducing the risk of death in half.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">That data is playing very well around the world, and it has helped us to penetrate now 8 out of every 10 new eligible patients in lung. So we feel as though will - there'll be a lot of data readouts here from competition, but we feel as though our data positions us well in lung today and in the future.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">NRDL, we are waiting to see if we'll be invited to - actually participate for next year. It is an important potential listing. It does expand the population in China fairly significantly. There is 5 to 600,000 lung cancer patients in China. There is probably 300,000 of those that are a part of our labeled indication and NRDL gives us a chance if invited to expand into that patient population.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We'd also like to highlight, we expect to expand our label in China. China is going to be important for us, not only for 2020, but 2020 and beyond and we are also seeing good self-pay market uptake in China as well, but clearly we will keep you informed as the NRDL process unfolds.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks. We'll move on to the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">It's from Steve Scala with Cowen.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Scala</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. A couple of questions, both for Roger. If you could clarify your KEYNOTE-522 comments, I think you said you needed EFS to file, but that you would share the PCR data with regulators. So were you implying you would seek to file and potentially garner approval on PCR? That is why you're going to share in the first place, or are you saying you absolutely definitely need the EFS.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then secondly if Bristol's 227 delivered a percent of patients alive greater than the 69% that KEYNOTE-189 reported at 12 months, just wondering how Merck would respond or do you think that is extremely unlikely? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">All right, Steve. So with respect to KEYNOTE-522 you know the goal I'm discussing, the data with regulatory agencies is to ask whether or not they think that represents a finding of sufficient importance to consider making the drug available for patients in that setting. So that's the reason to do it.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As I indicated pathological complete response is associated with favorable outcome, particularly in the breast cancer setting and his been repeatedly demonstrated to have that impact in the triple negative breast cancer setting. On the other hand, this is something that agencies have to look at, and with regard to the totality of the data. So that's -- that's basically where we are there.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And with regard to 227, pretty hard to respond to hypothetical without actually seeing what the data look like. I really, I don't know what to say about that. I know I'm - I think there is some interest in seeing what the subset data look like, obviously there - the flip side of that was, but, and maybe unsurprisingly that in light of what we've seen, beginning with the CheckMate-026, I mean, the combination of nivolumab plus chemotherapy was not successful.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">In part 2 which for us KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, obviously gives very impressive results in terms of overall response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival. As we've demonstrated repeatedly and in non-squamous and squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer. So you know those of these are behaving differently in these settings for whatever reason.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. We'll move on to the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Louise Chen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on KEYTRUDA in China. Just curious if you will disclose sales there. We get that question a lot, seeing if you can provide any color. And then how will you compete with the local players that are much less expensive on a price basis at least for now?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then second question is just on potential competition for KEYTRUDA from some of the upcoming trial readouts in second half ' 19 and beyond that will be a non-small cell lung cancer RCC and melanoma? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Frank?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. So we don't intend to actually share our sales number for KEYTRUDA in China. As far as competing with the local players, we feel as though oncology is a data-driven market there, clearly our local players that are entering the market at a lower price, they are penetrating into some segments of the market.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">However, we're continuing to see very good penetration and very good growth in China there are clearly, patients that are in the self-pay market is where we compete today, they can afford KEYTRUDA. We have our patient assistance programs and we have a very strong commercial presence in China. So I feel really, really good that we'll be able to compete with the local players going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. And then the KEYTRUDA positioning in the US given peer file.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank Clyburn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. I think as we mentioned, it is going to be a lot of competitive data readouts in lung and across many different cancer types. What I would say is, right now we are in a very strong first mover advantage in many of those cancer types. When you think about 20 indications across 12 different tumors, we right now have build a wall of data that we feel very comfortable with, and in fact many of the community oncologists are getting significant real world experience using KEYTRUDA.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So we'll have to see how the data unfolds with the competition, but as Roger and I have just mentioned, we feel as though our data right now, strong overall survival across many different cancer types, bladder, renal, cell carcinoma. I haven't even spoken about adjuvant melanoma, which is a very important launch for us right now. Head and neck, the teams are just launching that indication of strong overall survival in the first-line setting.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So we know it's going to be competitive, we feel as though we're very well positioned based on our strategy and the data that we have as well as what you heard at our Investor Day, the significant amount of data to come, not only in the metastatic setting, but also in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Frank. We'll take the next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It's from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Mara Goldstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Thank you, can you --</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Mara we can't hear your - we couldn't hear your question. If you wouldn't mind, repeating that.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Mara Goldstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure. Thank you very much. I have two questions. And the first is on the KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza trials and non-small cell lung cancer. And I'm just wondering what the expectation is in terms of expanding patient population based on that clinical trial.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then the second question is one around regulatory strategy in Europe, just understanding that yesterday or the day before heard that the CHMP had removed accelerated status for Novartis' Zolgensma, but we've also seen this is not an isolated incident with other drugs and in particular oncology drugs being taken off that accelerated track. And I'm wondering if the Company can share any thoughts around this dynamic and any potential impact on your own regulatory plans in Europe?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Roger Perlmutter</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Right. Mara, the underlying logic behind KEYTRUDA plus Lynparza and a whole variety of settings is that where there are defects in DNA repair and there are - those are included a whole variety of different defects, not just the BRCA 1, BRCA 2 indication for the whole variety of different molecular defects.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The effect of Lynparza can be to increase the representation of epitopes that potentially could be recognizable by immune cells and release of constraints with KEYTRUDA and combination with that should be beneficial. Thus far hypothesis that's being tested, whole variety of different settings and quite broadly. So we are enthusiastic about it. We're encouraged that this could be extremely important.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">As one of the things I would point out with respect to Lynparza is it's extraordinarily well tolerated, people stay on it for years, and the ability to maintain a treatment effect as has been shown for example in the ovarian setting is really quite remarkable. So that's extremely promising.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">With regard to EU strategy, the regulatory strategy really hasn't changed there. The EU has a prime program for - within CHMP in order to permit more rapid review. In general a good thing about EU reviews is that they now go along a very well defined timeline which we understand extremely well. And at this point, we are moving forward with those EU reviews as we've announced, even just this week. So all of that is going very well for us.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Teri Loxam</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks, Roger. And we were able to get to all of the callers' questions. So I'll turn it over to Ken for some closing comments.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Kenneth Frazier</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. I want to thank you again for joining us today. As you can see our strong second quarter results reinforce, why we're still confident in our ability to deliver sustained strong growth not only this year, but beyond. And as we mentioned in Investor Day, we have a de-risked portfolio of innovative asset, together with our differentiated, scientific commercial, our capabilities and our ability to execute, we believe that uniquely positions Merck to deliver strong results for patients and shareholders well into the future. So, thanks again. We look forward to joining you in the future.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">This concludes the Merck &amp; Company Q2 sales and earnings conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I would like to turn the call over to Mike Spencer, General Manager of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Michael Spencer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events had on the financial results.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing our underlying performance businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to growth rate only.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We will post our prepared remarks to the website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, and other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Satya Nadella</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was a strong finish to a record fiscal year. We delivered more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our Commercial Cloud business is the largest in the world surpassing $38 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 63%.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I’m proud of what we've accomplished over the last 12 months, and I'm energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead. Every day, we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability, creating new businesses with them, innovating with them, and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers’ success is resulting in deeper partnerships, larger multiyear cloud agreements, and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now, I will briefly highlight our innovation and momentum. In a world where every company is a software company, developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization, and GitHub is their home. GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises, including the majority of the Fortune 50. And we’re investing to build the complete toolchain for developers, independent of language, framework, and cloud.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world. With Azure DevOps, you could build, test, and deploy code to any platform; and with Azure PlayFab, we have LiveOps, a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We are building Azure as the world's computer addressing customers’ real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. We’ve 54 data Center regions, more than any other cloud provider, and we were the first in Middle East and in Africa. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge spanning identity, management, security, and infrastructure</p>, <p class=""p p2"">This year, we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect, bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated. Azure Sphere is the first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU powered endpoints coming online each year. And now, IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Azure is the most open cloud, and in this quarter, we expanded our partnerships with Oracle, Red Hat, and VMware, to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure. Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers' entire data estate. The variety, velocity, and the volume of data is increasing, and we’re bringing hyper-scale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database, new analytics support in cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data, and we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The quintessential characteristic of any application being built in 2019 and beyond will be AI. We are democratizing AI infrastructure tools and services with Azure Cognitive Services, the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, so developers can embed the ability to see, hear, respond, translate, reason, and more into their applications.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">And this quarter, we introduced a new speech-to-text, search, vision, and decision capabilities. New updates to Azure ML streamline the building, training, and deployment of machine learning models bringing a no-code approach to machine learning. Our differentiated approach from developer tools and infrastructure to data and analytics to AI is driving growth. The world's leading companies trust Azure for their mission-critical workloads, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. And just yesterday AT&amp;T chose our cloud in one of the largest cloud commitments to date.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now let's move up the stack to business process. We are redefining business processes with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform with modern, modular, extensible, and AI driven applications. Dynamics 365 uniquely enables any organization to create digital feedback loops and take data from one system and use it to optimize the outcomes of another, enabling any business to become an AI first business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our open data initiative with SAP and Adobe builds on this promise giving customers like Coke, HP, Unilever, and Walmart a single 360 view of their customers built on one data model and on one data lake eliminating data silos and driving real-time insights at scale.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">This year, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where systems of record are converted into systems of engagement and intelligence.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">The citizen developer movement is here, and we’re empowering it. 500 new -- 500 million new apps will get created in the next five years and more than the total created in the last 40. Businesses will need to empower domain experts with tools to create applications as well as robotic process automation to streamline and customize workflow like service monitoring and time and expense tracking.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our Power Platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps, &amp; Flow is the only solution of its kind in the industry. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation, and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive platform. Chevron has gone from 80 users of Power Apps to 5,500 in a year and now has over 200 apps in production. This quarter, we introduced AI Builder, adding AI capabilities like object recognition to any Power App. And with Power BI, we are the leader in business intelligence in the cloud with more than 25 million models hosted on the service and 12 million queries processed each hour.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We are enabling our customers to digitize not only their business processes but to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our investments in mixed reality cloud, spanning HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors and Dynamics 365 applications. We are seeing traction in every industry from manufacturing to retail to gaming. Airbus alone is pursuing more than 300 use cases from training to design to remote assistance. All this innovation is fueling rapid growth, with more than 90% of the Fortune 500 using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now to LinkedIn. People are an organization’s most valuable asset. Our strong Talent portfolio from Talent Solutions and Talent Insights, to employee engagement with Glint to LinkedIn Learning enables every organization to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs market. New capabilities help job seekers find and land more relevant and higher paying jobs through alerts, deeper insights and a new suite of interview prep tools, contributing to another quarter of record job postings.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Marketing Solutions is now our fastest growing business, with new brand and community building tools that make it easier for marketers to connect with LinkedIn’s 645 million members. And we are enabling every business to drive a culture of relationship selling and take full advantage of their social networks, with the combination of Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. All this innovation contributed to another record year for LinkedIn, driven by all-time high engagement across the platform.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now, turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud. It empowers everyone, including the 2 billion firstline workers around the world, with an integrated, secure, AI-infused experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity and collaboration and communications solution that integrates with an organization’s critical business process workflows.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Multinationals from L'Oreal and Walgreens Boots Alliance, to the largest chemical producer in the world, BASF, all chose Microsoft 365 this year. And over the last two quarters our premium offerings gained momentum, with S&amp;P Global, CenturyLink and KPMG all selecting Microsoft 365 E5.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. Teams now has more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. It brings together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office apps, and the business process workflows, into a single, integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discreet apps that only increase an organization’s security and compliance exposure. And we’re broadening our opportunity, bringing Teams to new and underpenetrated markets including healthcare, hospitality and retail, as well as firstline workers. We are empowering them with mobile tools in Teams, like shift scheduling and priority notifications.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And we are infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to enable new automation, prediction, translation and insights capabilities. Meetings are more inclusive in Teams, presentations are more accessible in PowerPoint, videos more searchable in Stream and emails more relevant in Outlook. And with Workplace Analytics and Microsoft Search, we take your relationships, schedules and activities and distill insights and knowledge, to help people work smarter, not longer.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We are investing in cybersecurity to protect customers in today’s “zero trust” environment. Microsoft is the only company that offers end-to-end security, spanning identity, device endpoints, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure. It starts with Azure Active Directory and builds with three new services we introduced this year: Microsoft Threat Protection, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Confidential Computing.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We expanded our family of category creating Surface devices this year, including the new Surface Go and Surface Hub 2S. And Windows 10 is active on more than 800 million devices, with accelerating adoption in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Finally, gaming. We are investing to empower the world’s two billion gamers to play the games they want, with anyone, anywhere on any device with our new game streaming service, Project xCloud, which will enter public trials this fall. Xbox Live Monthly Active Users increased to a record 65 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users-to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We are bringing one of the world’s most popular video games to a new generation of mobile gamers with Minecraft Earth and mixed reality. And we nearly doubled our first party game studios this year to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, now available on both console and PC.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In closing, I’m optimistic of what’s ahead. We are accelerating our innovation to deliver differentiated value to customers across the cloud and the edge from GitHub to Azure to Dynamics 365 to Microsoft 365 as well as Xbox Game Pass. We are investing in the right secular trends to expand our opportunity and we are working to earn our customers’ trust every day.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Amy Hood</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter revenue was $33.7 billion, up 12% and 14% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency. Operating income increased 20% and 24% in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">This quarter we transferred intangible properties from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion. When adjusting for this and the net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the fourth quarter of FY18, earnings per share was $1.37, increasing 21% and 24% in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results, which drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to grow. In FY19, we closed a record number of multi-million dollar commercial cloud agreements, with material growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure agreements. Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations, increasing 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As a result, our contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion, up 25% year-over-year, reflecting our continued momentum and growing long-term customer commitment. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue in the next 12 months. Even with the higher mix of larger, long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings, commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $34.1 billion, up 13% and 16% in constant currency. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 90%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Commercial Cloud revenue was $11 billion, growing 39% and 42% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year to 65%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. The Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix shift to commercial licensing and OEM.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In line with expectations, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by 1 point. Operating expenses grew slightly ahead of expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, LinkedIn, and GitHub.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Operating margins expanded again this quarter, as a result of strong revenue growth, improving gross margins, and disciplined decisions we’ve made over the past 5 years to invest in strategic and high growth areas.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11 billion, increasing 14% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by both our cloud and on-premises businesses.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Office commercial revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, including roughly 4 points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition that benefited both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 31% and 34% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as ARPU growth from our customers’ continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Office 365 commercial seats grew 23% on a prior year comparable that included the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office Consumer revenue grew 6% and 8% in constant currency, with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew 34.8 million.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our Dynamics business grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 45% and 48% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 28% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 22%, with record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 20% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 25% and 31% in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.4 billion, increasing 19% and 21% in constant currency. Our on-premises server business drove our better than expected performance. Continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid solutions drove strong server products and cloud services revenue growth, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency on a significant revenue base.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Azure revenue increased 64% and 68% in constant currency with another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business and continued moderation in our per-user business. And our on-premises server business grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, with roughly 4 points from stronger than expected demand ahead of end of support for SQL and Windows server 2008, as well as continued strength across our hybrid offerings, premium versions, and GitHub. Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was flat year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Operating expenses increased 23% and 24% in constant currency, driven by on-going investments in Cloud and AI engineering and GitHub, as well as revenue driven expenses given the strength of the quarter. Operating income increased 15% and 19% in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $11.3 billion, increasing 4% and 6% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better than expected performance in Windows more than offset lower than expected Gaming and Search revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 8%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 18%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by healthy Windows 10 demand, strong momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support, and roughly 4 points of benefit from increased inventory levels due to uncertainty around tariffs. Therefore, inventory levels ended the quarter above the normal range.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 16% in constant currency, with strong double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 14% and 17% in constant currency driven by strength in our commercial segment, particularly in the U.S., Japan, and Canada.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Search revenue ex TAC increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower than expected volume. In Gaming, revenue declined 10% and 8% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower console sales and monetization across third party titles.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Xbox software and services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency with the tough comparable from a third-party title in the prior year offsetting continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to our higher margin Windows businesses. Operating expenses declined 2% and 1% in constant currency. As a result, operating income grew 18% and 22% in constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now back to total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including finance leases were up sequentially to $5.3 billion driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&amp;E was $4.1 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Cash flow from operations increased 41% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections and roughly 8 points of benefit from tax payments made in the prior year. Free cash flow was $12 billion and increased 62% year-over-year, reflecting strong operating cash flows and the timing of cash payments for PP&amp;E.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">For the fiscal year, we generated over $52 billion in operating cash flow and $38 billion in free cash flow, driven by improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses, as well as operating improvements to better optimize cash flow.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Other income was $191 million, higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains. As a reminder, under the recently adopted accounting standards for financial investments, we’re required to recognize unrealized gains or losses on our equity portfolio. As a result, we expect increased quarterly volatility in other income and expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 16%.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And finally, this quarter, we returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 45%, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $30 billion for the full fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now let’s move to our outlook, starting with Q1, where we expect another strong commercial quarter. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and more Personal Computing revenue and total company COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">In our commercial business, we expect continued customer demand to drive commercial unearned revenue up 11% to 12% year-over-year with volatility based on contract type. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be up slightly on a sequential basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion driven by double-digit growth in Office commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect a balance of strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings, as well as the continued benefit from the end of support for SQL Server and Windows Server 2008.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $11 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be slightly ahead of the PC market driven by healthy commercial demand. Surface revenue will decline slightly year over year driven by product lifecycle transitions. Search ex TAC revenue growth should be roughly in line with Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline year over year at a similar rate to Q4 as we move through the end of this console generation and a challenging Xbox software and services comparable from a third-party title in the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expenses should offset each other.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Next, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full-year expected rate of 17% due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. And finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making a $4.7 billion tax payment related to TCJA transition tax and the Q4 transfer of intangible property.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now I would like to share some comments on FY20. First, FX. Assuming that current rates remain stable, we expect FX to reduce full-year revenue and COGS growth by 1 point. FX should have no impact on operating expense growth.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Next, revenue. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth with another year of strong performance and continued momentum in our commercial business. As a reminder, our commercial licensing and OEM Pro businesses in the second half of the year will be impacted by a comparable that benefitted from the end of support of SQL server 2008, Windows server 2008, and Windows 7, as well as transactional strength in Japan.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We expect revenue in our gaming business to be down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in Xbox Software and Services will be offset by declining console sales. We do expect a stronger H2 than H1 in Gaming as we work through a third-party title comparison.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And as a reminder, an increasing number of large, long-term Azure contracts will drive more quarterly volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Next, commercial cloud gross margin. Revenue mix will continue to shift to our Azure consumption-based services. Even with this headwind, we expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to be up slightly as we again drive meaningful improvement in Azure gross margin. Capital expenditures will increase to meet the growing demand for our cloud services.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Finally, on operating expenses, we will continue to invest given our strong execution, growing competitive position, and our significant ambition in high growth areas. Investment in areas like Cloud through AI and GitHub, Business Applications through Dynamics, Power Platform, and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security, and Surface as well as Gaming should result in operating expense growth of 11% to 12%.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Even with these strategic investments, the continued shift to our cloud business, and our very strong finish to FY19, we expect double-digit operating income growth as well as stable operating margins. We are looking forward to FY20.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">With that, Mike, let's go to Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Michael Spencer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks, Amy. We will now move over to Q&amp;A. With respect for others on the call, we request the participants to please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?</p>, <p class=""p p8"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a really strong FY19. I wanted to focus on the Office 365. If I’m looking at this right, I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 commercial business and in the kind of recipe to getting there seems to have changed a little bit of that as more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth. Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what’s pushing growth there, because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit. It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter. How should we think about sort of the dynamics, what’s going to be driving growth for Office 365 into FY20 and beyond?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks, Keith. Let me walk through a little bit of this, because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter, but the fundaments that you talked about are relatively unchanged. We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. That’s happening not just because of frontline workers, but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base. We did see ARPU growth this quarter. It wasn’t as much different from the -- from past quarters. We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transitions, saw both again. And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance, particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. What you saw a little bit and I referred to it was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that’s happening because it's got two important and positive trends that underlie it. The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments. When you see longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. And so, we saw longer commitment and we’ve got a little bit more recognition in the quarter, and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster. The other thing that we saw is increasing focus as we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions. And so, the fact that we then -- we’re often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. When that happens, it's almost like you’re adding new products and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen. And so, when you have a dynamic where you’re seeing longer contracts plus you’re able to sell more and new things, and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365, it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero -- hero experience.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Excellent. Sounds great.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Keith. Operator, we will move to next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you very much and congratulations not only on the great end to the year, but confidence into next -- not next quarter and next year in terms of growth, investment, et cetera. We met recently at E3 with your gaming team and heard a lot about the steps that were being taken. Satya, can you give us more color, explanation -- excuse me, on how you see the gaming business fitting into the overall company's direction over next the few years, specifically how does gaming change? How does the synergy between gaming and the rest of the business change? How should we think about that overall mix and that whole [ph] morph that’s going to occur? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. First, I’d say we are in gaming because of what we believe are going to be the secular changes in the gaming addressable market for us. We’ve always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC, but going forward, we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games, which is where our structural position is. And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming, we’ve a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming, in spite of all the success we’ve had over the years in gaming. Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment. So, if you think about what we are doing with xCloud, it's a hero workload on top of Azure. So when we think about capital allocation, what’s happening in the Cloud, what’s happening in the Edge, how we build the network to optimize for streaming the same infrastructure, for example, is what Sony has decided to use as well, and be on Azure as well as use our AI capability. So, you will see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will take the next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions for Amy. Just thinking through with the Azure mix becoming an ever bigger portion of IC revenue and when you factor in continued gross margin expansion that you continue to show in Azure, how should we think about the gross margin potential of IC overall? And I guess, I also wanted to ask about the build out of data centers related to the cloud build out, how do we think about your points of presence today from a coverage perspective, if you will, versus the regional -- the revenue pockets that you’re targeting over the next few years? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term. Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that. So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number. But of course a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course operating margin dollar growth as we move forward. When it comes to our build out, Heather, I tend to think two components. The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity. It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build out. We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly. But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thank you very much, Amy.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, Heather. Operator, next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thank you. Satya, you mentioned the AT&amp;T deal that was announced, I think earlier this week. IBM also had an announcement with AT&amp;T. Oracle has been a long time partner with AT&amp;T in the cloud as well. I don’t want to dwell on AT&amp;T in particular, but I do think it's interesting that a few different large scale cloud players are around the table there. So as you see more of these very large deals out there and Amy mentioned the increase in $10 million deals. How often are those multi-cloud deals and companies taking that sort of approach versus once that are committing to Microsoft and how do you navigate that landscape?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, when I think overall, you all I think do a good job of tracking what is the public cloud competition and that’s the competition we pay most attention to. And in this context I think we see a mix. There a few of us who are at scale in public cloud who are very competitive, and anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. When someone thinks that only using one cloud, we're definitely one of the names. And in the case of AT&amp;T we were the only public cloud in there. And so that’s why we highlighted -- they highlighted us and we highlighted that in our quarterly announcement.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And I will think general what we see, especially as contract gets larger, for us the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth. It's just expansive. And so, Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we’ve a incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today, that footprint and you can see it in our results. Customers are relying on us for not only that footprint, but as they continue to expand to sit under the Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before. And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitments is an opportunity, I think, you will continue to see us execute well on.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, Jen. Operator, we will take the next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Karl Keirstead</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Amy, I’ve got a question about the Windows business. A couple of the metrics, 18% Windows OEM Pro and 16% on the volume licensing side were extraordinary. I know you called out a couple of, call it, one-time issues around inventory levels and an uptick in in-quarter revs. But I wanted to ask you two questions. How much of a tail do you think we’ve left on the Win7 to Win10 migration? Is it too cautious to say that there's really just two quarters of that tailwind left? And, secondly, on the volume licensing or commercial and cloud services segment, do you think that can, in fiscal '20 contribute to your overall double-digit growth? Thanks a lot.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, Karl. And I will actually combine these, because really those are fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. There's, I think a recognized momentum with Windows 10 if deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop. We worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest on security for all of our products. One of the places I think it often resonates the most is with Windows 10 and inside that value. The OEM Pro number as I talked about was impacted by a number of factors, but what we’ve seen is over the past three or four quarters, a pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts and chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. That performance certainly has some end of support impact to it as we've talked about before. I think, in general, what we've seen in prior releases is, it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and mid-sized business customers, and it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have. And so, we will see some extension pass the line, we certainly have seen three or four quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong. The more important part around the security management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit, because it's the same thing we saw in Office. The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers, especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4, has three components. It has Office 365, it has EMS, and it has its Windows 10 commercial component. The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success and our motion and overall being able to sell the Microsoft 360 value prop. It was a good quarter for that. We’ve seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. I expect that to continue, although you will have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is, it has a little bit more 606 impact than we’ve felt it's an on-prem product. And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Karl Keirstead</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay, terrific. Thanks, Amy.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Karl. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey. Thanks, guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close to a great year. I just wanted to focus in on M 365, particularly Satya your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of two components for this question. How do you think about sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones that you highlighted at Ignite Conference. Is it the fact, let's say, single app with those combined features you talked about or is it the broader, you call it, Office experience? And then, I guess a question for Amy then off of that. When you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going forward basis to keep this migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like Calling etcetera, how critical is Teams to this -- to the long-term, call it, like, price migration here at Office and M 365?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. So, overall, I think there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we’re seeing. And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly, but each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind. But Teams is -- transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool, it's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line. The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers. Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. And the thing that we have realized is, that businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first line worker productivity. So we’re in a very early innings of it, but we are pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. And Teams in some sense helps them a lot, because it builds on all the rest of the investment they’ve made already in Office 365. And so we see that benefit even on that front.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. I mean, we’ve all these components value, that's really that’s been the secret of what customers look and see. They see Teams that can not only change what Satya talked about, but also develop culture change in terms of employees being able to be involved and collaborate regardless of the org chart and that is what you're going to see. When we have 500 million new applications built in the next five years, you're going to see and I believe Teams to be one of the major interfaces through which that experience and business process reinvention will happen. Teams really expand multiple categories, so I wouldn't think of adjusted productivity or even just collab or meetings but as an interface. As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this as the surface through which many people will experience that. And so, I would ask to try to expand your thinking on this one, it's not just Office or needed to be an Office, it's really about having employees fundamentally experience Microsoft in a different way day-to-day.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes and I would point to the conference we just finished and some of the demos, and I think the customer demos, in particular, I would say, that will sort of probably give you the best feel for how people look at this in terms of the deployment characteristics.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Phil. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Mark Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you very much. Amy, you’re mentioning large and long-term Azure contracts. I'm wondering as we consider this robust 25% growth in your commercial bookings this quarter, roughly how many points are coming from that -- from any tailwind of the longer duration types of contracts? And then, Satya, I wanted to ask you regarding the recent partnership with AT&amp;T. Some media report said it was worth over $2 billion. Wondering if there's some hyperbole there in the media, or is this an example of how Microsoft can play in every line of the company's OpEx budgets today?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I will just take the second one then you can go on. I mean I think it is a very significant deal. I’m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we’ve signed of the size and we see -- we’ve line of sight to many more such deals.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Amy Hood</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">When we think about bookings growth, I'm not sure -- for me -- break it down into two pieces, which is I think about bookings which were very good this quarter, has two fundamental motions. There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new. Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone and being the only component of the new. And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we’ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction. So, while these long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our -- see in our balance of $91 billion and see that that also grew 25% year-over-year, you will get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Mark Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hey, thanks and congrats from me as well. I wanted to zone in on Dynamics. There, you obviously like, you’re playing in applications and we've seen other vendors kind of do SaaS applications. If you look at Dynamics Online, you now on my math kind of around $2 billion, but still growing at a clip that organically, not many others have achieved. It's now bigger than your on-premise business. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? And is there -- what are the ways to kind of keep in -- how did you achieve that over this scale and what are the drivers going forward? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, we’re very, very excited about the progress again in the last fiscal year around Dynamics 365. Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and a much more modern and we’ve a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. And so, therefore, we’re becoming much more competitive with very large customers deploying whether it's sales or operations. The other exciting thing is we’ve this entire new class of applications and I talked about this even into this week's conference, which is these AI-first modules, whether it's for sales, for marketing, for customer service or this Customer 360. And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere, no competition even exist. So in other words, we can in fact have these modules get deployed in commercial customers even on top of existing business applications. And so we feel that we’ve plenty of opportunity ahead. Again, this is a place where we’re a very low share player. And so the fact that we will become a very competitive supplier of this technology at a time where the world needs more business process automation, we feel good about the opportunity ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">All right. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Spencer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we will take our last question now, please.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Please proceed.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Brent Bracelin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you for taking question here. I wanted to drill down in the Commercial Cloud gross margins. They were up 200 basis points sequentially, 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. I guess, my question here is how sustainable are the cloud gross margins now that you're at this $40 billion plus scale, or were there some kind of one-time benefits we should think about in the quarter that helped you there? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Satya Nadella</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us. This is really about seeing improvement in some of our largest services and continue to see improvement year-over-year in the largest services. What we said for FY20 and certainly in Q1 as we expected to be up sequentially in Q1 and we will continue to get some headwind because of the strong Azure IaaS and PaaS growth we expect through the year, but we certainly think that Azure fundamental gross margin improvement will help offset that next year.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Brent Bracelin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Michael Spencer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">That wraps up the Q&amp;A portion of today's earnings call. We appreciate you joining us, and look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>A - Amy Hood</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Satya Nadella</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you, all. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Leading today's call is Matt Friend, CFO NIKE Operating Segments and Vice President, Investor Relations.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before I turn the call over to Mr. Friend, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including the annual report filed on Form 10-K.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2020 first quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, at our Web site investors.nike.com.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event that you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I’ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Mark Parker</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Many of you know Matt. I'd like to welcome him to his first call as he takes on the responsibility of Investor Relations. And then of course on behalf of the whole team, I’d like to thank Nitesh for his partnership over the last several years.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Turning to the results, we feel very good about our performance in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, growing revenue 10% on a currency neutral basis. It was a quarter that proved the depth and balance of our complete offense, building on the strengths of our foundational business drivers and capitalizing on the untapped dimensions of our portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">For the quarter, this is reflected in the broad-based growth in all geographies, led by our international business, which grew 16%; in double-digit growth in our women's business off the back of an incredible summer of celebrating female athletes; in both footwear and apparel with our strong lineup of innovation and style which continues to feed the growing consumer demand for comfortable athletic product; and in digital which grew a very strong 42% showing the power of more personal relationships with the consumer.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Mobile continues to lead the way and within mobile, app experiences are fueling the most growth. And while this trend has held true in our own channels for some time, we’re beginning to leverage our digital experiences with our retail partners. As we set out to do, we’re creating a differentiated marketplace for NIKE by scaling our learnings and best in class experiences with our partners.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The key to expanding our competitive edge continues to be our total commitment to the consumer through the consumer-direct offense. We’re focused. We’re investing in our brand in key markets and we're accelerating in the high growth dimensions of our business. And that’s especially important in the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that we see today.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In relation to tariffs, we've been clear that we strongly believe in the power of free and fair trade. Historically, we've effectively navigated through excessive duties and we’re confident that we’ll continue to do so under the current dynamic. In China, specifically, we continue to extend NIKE’s lead. In our key cities of Beijing and Shanghai, we serve a generation of digital-first consumers and we support their love of sport by helping to grow participation through grassroots programs.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As I’ve said before, NIKE is a brand of China for China and the results continue to prove it out. We’ve driven double-digit growth in Greater China every quarter for more than five years. This quarter, we continued that momentum with an outstanding 27% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. In any environment, NIKE’s foundation for success has always been great product. We continue to see that today with another huge quarter for NIKE innovation.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're delivering more choice and fresh options on some of our hottest products and expansion of both new and existing platforms and a deeper commitment to serving a wider range of athletes. Sportswear continues to lead all categories in both footwear and apparel growing strong double-digits. One of NIKE’s greatest strengths is how we mix style and innovation, and the Air Max React 270 is a perfect example. We’ve created a runway hit by blending Air Max and React with multiple bold colorways. In fact, the 270 Air Max React led to the largest gains in footwear revenue for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Another strong addition to our lineup this quarter is the Air Max 200, the layered upper with a new visible Air Sole unit continues to build on the energy we’re driving in running silhouettes. We’re also reimagining and clearly segmenting our top sportswear franchises like the Air Force 1 and Tech Fleece. By adapting the Air Force 1 into models like the N.354 and the Sage, we grew the Air Force 1 businesses with women's and kids faster than men’s this quarter. It’s an approach we’re using with our Tech Fleece collection too adding new silhouettes and shapes throughout our lines.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our strategy of designing apparel through themes and collections continues to connect with the consumer, as we drove double-digit growth in sportswear apparel for the 22nd consecutive quarter. Our kids business is one that doesn't get a lot of attention on our calls but it is in fact a critical part of our business. Overall, kids’ footwear and apparel just experienced its biggest back-to-school season ever, driving double-digit growth for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In kids, we’re earning significant gains through core footwear and apparel for both boys and girls and in basketball and the Air Max 270 which drove triple-digit growth for kids’ power franchises. How we present and distributed kids’ product also provides new opportunities. We see more parents buying on our apps, so we continue to invest in more dynamic imagery on our digital platforms and we’re testing new business models through membership to make it easier for parents to buy at the pace that their kids need new product.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In performance product, we saw very strong momentum in basketball internationally this quarter especially with the AlphaDunk. To be honest, we’re excited about the long-term potential of this signature line. Not only did the Zoom Freak 1 become the largest initial signature launch in NIKE basketball history, its apparel line sold out quickly as well with the Freak T-shirt becoming the top selling apparel item on Nike.com.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">This quarter, we were all inspired by the incredible athletes and performances at the Women's World Cup. It was also a tremendous stage for NIKE innovation. During the all-NIKE final, we also debuted our top football boot innovation, the Mercurial 2019. In addition, apparel revenue from the 2019 Women's World Cup was 4x bigger than it was for the 2015 event. Across the wider business, we stayed intensely focused on the apparel classifications that matter the most to the female athlete; bras and tights.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For the quarter, the light-support Indy Bra led the way and our NIKE One Tight is creating incredible demand, especially in NIKE direct and strategic retail partner doors. The NIKE One collection is a great example of our edit to amplify approach that will stretch to other categories putting more focus on our most profitable items across price points and distribution channels.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In running, we launched Joyride which was designed to encourage more everyday athletes to get moving. We're excited about the incredible comfort this system delivers with responsive beads that conform to the foot. The customer response to the running silhouette this quarter was very strong and we’re just now beginning to scale the Joyride platform across multiple categories through women’s, sportswear and kids.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As we began to communicate through Joyride, one of the biggest opportunity for NIKE is to continue to serve an even wider range of athletes. As leader in our industry, we will add to the growing movement of health and wellness around the world. We’ve been broadening our definition of sport through our brand, but more and more we’re doing it through product innovation.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">From competition to fitness to light activity to play, our more inclusive view on design is opening up new lanes of opportunity for growth. For example, we’re studying the fit of our products to serve more body types with our successful plus size line. Our teams are designing for modesty to match more people’s preferences and our FLYEASE system has been updated for easier entry and exit to appeal to even more people.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We will be expanding into a new high performance basketball shoe and one of the most coveted sneakers of all time, the Air Jordan 1. Making more athletes comfortable and confident can be an incredible catalyst to bringing more people into sport and that’s a theme we’ll continue to champion as we lead into the Tokyo Olympics.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">On last quarter’s call we told you that the Jordan brand was accelerating and finished with over $3 billion in revenue for fiscal '19. Jordan followed up that record breaking year with the quarter of healthy double-digit growth in all geographies, including mid-teens growth in North America. We're growing at an accelerated pace in new areas like performance basketball, women's, international and apparel and the Air Jordan 1 franchise continues to create incredible demand all over the world.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">This quarter, we were incredibly excited to announce that Zion joined the Jordan family. We’re proud that Zion will wear the Air Jordan 34 to start this season and we’re already developing new innovation with one of the NBA's most anticipated rookies. Looking over the next few seasons, our pipeline is set to fuel growth in our biggest businesses while also carving out new space for future opportunities.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">New LeBron and Kyrie signature models will arrive as the NBA season gets started. Women's apparel will lead with new materials of performance types. Training will introduce a new franchise designed for a range of fitness activities, including high-intensity workouts, station-based training and spinning classes. Running will introduce more innovation that’s proven to help make athletes faster as we headed into Tokyo. And our adaptive platform will continue to evolve with new features like voice activation from your phone. There’s much more to come from NIKE innovation in fiscal year '20.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">While products are usually the first to grab the attention of our consumers, we deepened those relationships through the power of digital. To do that, we’re investing in three areas. We're building industry leading personal experiences. We're quickly ramping up our backend capabilities to capture more of that demand. And the final critical piece is to create scale through our own channels and with our partners.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Membership sits at the heart of that strategy giving consumers a more personal relationship with NIKE. Fundamentally, that gives them easier access to more tailored products and services. With product, there are multiple advantages to being a logged in member. In some cases, it means they have early access to our latest innovation like we did this quarter with the launch of Joyride and the Air Max 270 React. It can also be as simple as giving better access to the product they want in the moment, so you’re capturing more full-price demand. Connected inventory is critical to that capability.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With services, we’re bringing real value to our members’ lives consistently. Our teams are assessing different ways to engage with more people completely and have them coming back for more. Over the last three years, we more than doubled the number of active users across all of our apps. With more active engagement we create more value for both our members and for NIKE.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In this quarter, for example, over 50% of our NIKE direct digital growth came from numbers. Becoming personal at scale is the ultimate objective. We start in our own channels and then amplify those experiences through partnerships. The sneakers app has truly redefined our connection with the sneaker community. It’s now in 22 countries with more room to grow in EMEA and APLA and grew roughly 50% this quarter. We've also begun to test a new opportunity within sneakers on high heat apparel. The early read from our members on our pilots has been very positive.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As I’ve said before, the NIKE app is the most comprehensive one-stop shop for NIKE. It’s become the largest and fastest-growing platform in our portfolio, growing almost triple digits this quarter. The NIKE app is already in 21 countries and will go live in China in holiday. Just as exciting is the impact that the NIKE app is having on the physical shopping experience. It’s scaling in North America and features can be now activated in every store owned NIKE location, most factory stores including most factory stores and in this quarter alone we added nearly 1 million new NIKE members from interactions in our North America doors.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">NIKE Fit is our technology that scans the foot, eliminating a significant consumer friction point by providing an accurate read of a users shoe size. The in-store experience is currently available in all North America locations and is moving quickly into Europe and Japan. We’ll also be launching an at-home in app experience later this fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We’re moving at an impressive pace in the channels that we control and while we continue to invest in stronger more distinctive partnerships. When coming together with another platform or retailer, our objective is to create a better experience in the path of the consumer. We want them to be able to move seamlessly from online to offline and easily find the product they want, when they want it across the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Ultimately by recognizing, serving and rewarding members, it will engage with NIKE more often across multiple channels and touch points. Our teams continue to be very active in this space. NIKE App at Retail is already showing the ability to scale with partners.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">This quarter, for the first time, NIKE App at Retail features and NIKE membership were activated with a wholesaler through a pilot with Foot Locker’s Washington Heights store. We plan to integrate NIKE App at Retail in more Foot Locker doors in North America and bring new experiences to Zalando in Europe and top sports in China later this fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our inventory partnership program also continued to scale, including Zalando, JD and Pro-Direct in Europe. And we're leveraging the world's top social media platforms with Instagram where consumers can use direct messaging for commerce in our women's and training channels and with WeChat with a new feature that allows users to check product availability in nearby stores instantly.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">A critical component to accelerating all of our opportunities is our ability to become smarter through our supply chain. And to do that we’re bringing science to the art of retail like never before. With Zodiac, we've acquired proprietary technology and teams to better know our members, give them better experiences and expand their lifetime value to the NIKE brand.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Invertex brought us computer visioning capabilities for NIKE Fit which we talked about and in addition to more accurate fitting sizes we’re already using the insights we gain to inform better design product. And just last month we acquired a new predictive analytics platform and team of data scientists through our acquisition of Celect. This game will greatly accelerate our ability to turn raw data into actionable demand insights, and this allows us to make more accurate inventory decisions closer to market.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We’re partnering, investing in our own teams and we’re gaining new capabilities all in the name of serving the consumer more completely. It was a great start to the year for NIKE. The global shift towards more active lifestyles continues to accelerate and demand for athletic product is high.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As a company, we have a sharper focus on these areas that will drive the greatest growth. We’re bringing the joy of sport to even more people and we continue to build our more valuable relationships with the consumer through the power of digital. Our fundamentals are strong, but what excites me the most is the significant opportunity ahead for our industry and for NIKE.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks. And now here’s Andy.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Andy Campion</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. First, I want to take a moment to personally thank Nitesh for his incredibly valuable partnership and leadership over Investor Relations as he now transitions into a new and expanded set of responsibilities. And I also want to welcome Matt to his first call as he expands his responsibilities to include leadership over Investor Relations.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In Q1, we came out of the block strong with our results meeting or exceeding the expectations we set 90 days ago on every dimension. Most notably, we delivered currency neutral revenue growth of 10%, 150 basis point of gross margin expansion, EPS growth of 28% and high expanding returns on invested capital. Those are extraordinary numbers, but what we're most excited about is the quality of our performance.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our financial performance in Q1 reflects exceptional strategic execution by our teams around the world. We continue on our relentless drive to transform how NIKE serves consumers. There are three key themes that really stand out when we reflect on Q1. One, the strategic transformation of NIKE continues to be the fuel for accelerating broad-based growth across our global portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Two, this transformational growth is not happening by accident. Our targeted investments are extending our competitive advantage. And three, while the geopolitical and macro environment is increasingly volatile and in some respects unpredictable, consumer sentiment for the NIKE brand remains incredibly strong and consistent around the world.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let’s go a bit deeper on these three themes. First, strategic transformation is driving our broad-based global growth. When it comes to creating value for shareholders it all starts with growth. And as Mark has said, when it comes to grow, at NIKE it all starts with product. NIKE is bringing innovative new product to market at an unrivaled pace and scale.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">New innovation platforms equated to over 100% of our incremental growth in Q1. That includes the successful launch of Joyride and strong sustained consumer demand for recently launched platforms from React to the range of compelling new Air Max platforms launched over the past two years such as VaporMax, 270, 720 and 200.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">At the same time digital is transforming and amplifying everything we do at NIKE. In Q1, NIKE digital grew 42% on a currency neutral basis driven by enhanced digital services and the expansion of our ecosystem internationally. The NIKE app and sneakers app are now both live in over 20 countries with more expansion coming over the balance of fiscal year '20.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As for the second key theme, we are making deliberate investments both organically and through acquisitions to extend NIKE’s competitive advantage. For example, we've enhanced our ability to test and scale new digital services faster by investing in the migration of over 95% of our consumer experiences to a more nimble cloud-based architectural.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our acquisition of Celect in Q1 was another accelerator of our transformation. Celect’s team and proprietary digital demand sensing tools will help us more effectively predict demand, plan supply, allocate product to the right stores and sharpen our pricing and markdown gains. Celect’s capabilities are first of their kind in our industry. Most other industries sell the same products season after season.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Celect has developed unique models the leverage data science and machine learning in our industry where we bring new and innovative product to market every season. The acquisition of Celect accelerates our building of digital demand sensing capabilities by at least three years.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities such as these to invest and extend our leadership and competitive advantage. At the same time, we’re also increasingly offsetting our incremental investment through the editing of resources within our legacy operating models.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The third key theme as we reflect on Q1 relates to the environment in which we’re operating. Despite increasingly dynamic and somewhat unpredictable macro and geopolitical factors, consumer sentiment and affinity for the NIKE brand remained strong and consistent. NIKE’s growth continues to outpace GDP growth and broader retail growth in our major markets around the world, and NIKE continues to be the number one favorite brand in our 12 key global cities.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Since launching our consumer direct offense two years ago, our currency neutral performance has exceeded our long-term financial model in terms of growth, profitability and return on invested capital and we see that momentum continuing over the balance of fiscal year '20. While the macro dynamics are even more volatile than they were 90 days ago, NIKE has a long track record of remaining agile and managing all of the levers we control.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We are also increasingly engaging with all of our constituents on the levers that are outside of our direct control. As a result, to-date our net real dollar reported results have remained strong and consistent. We continue to deliver strong financial performance despite FX having had a roughly $3 billion negative impact on our reported revenue and over $1.5 billion of negative impact on our EBIT over the past four years.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Despite the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds, we expect to continue delivering strong financial performance going forward. But before sharing our positive outlook for the balance of fiscal year '20, I’ll first touch on our reported Q1 results in a bit more detail.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis and 7% on a reported basis. Our stronger than projected overall growth reflects healthy balanced growth across all four of our geographies, led by NIKE digital globally in Greater China. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points in Q1 as average gross selling prices expanded and higher margin NIKE direct growth outpaced wholesale growth.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Q1 gross margin significantly exceeded our guidance, driven primarily by a shift in the timing of supply chain and other investments out of Q1 and into the balance of the year, significantly lower than planned markdown rates in our NIKE factory stores; in fact even lower than we’d expect in a typical quarter and the favorable mix impact from stronger than planned growth in our high-margin international geographies and NIKE direct. We nonetheless expect gross margin expansion over the balance of the fiscal year, though of course not at the same level as we saw in Q1. I’ll touch on this more specifically in our guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">SG&amp;A grew 9% in Q1 as we continue to invest in our digital transformation and in part driven by brand marketing associated with the Women's World Cup and the Joyride innovation launch. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.4% which would have been largely in line with guidance but for favorable non-recurring items.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.86. And as of August 31st, inventories were up 12% reflecting strong forward-looking consumer demand globally and also in support of key consumer moments such as back-to-school which has extended into September this year and looking ahead to Singles’ Day on 11.11 in Greater China.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now let’s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 4%. Our growth in Q1 was right on plan, led by digital from a channel perspective and sportswear in Jordan categorically. We are reshaping the marketplace in North America with NIKE digital growing over 30% on a currency neutral basis and with high single-digit growth across our key strategic and differentiated partners.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In Q1, we also drove an intentional decline in undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale. We continue to reallocate our best product and our retail investment dollars to NIKE direct and differentiated partner experiences. That includes, for example, testing new services, leveraging the NIKE app in partner doors such as in Washington Heights with Foot Locker.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now let’s turn to EMEA where revenue grew 12% on a currency neutral basis in Q1. Growth was broad based across our categories and amplified by strong double-digit growth in NIKE digital. We see continued strong digital momentum in Europe with the Nike app having just launched in 13 new countries across this geography.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We extended our lead in Europe in Q1 with the NIKE brand rated the number one favorite brand in all of our key cities and our business growing at strong double-digit rates in London, Berlin and Milan. While NIKE direct is a key driver, our strategic partnerships with JD and Zalando are also contributing to our strong sustained growth in Europe.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now let’s turn to Greater China, which continues to set the pace for NIKE's growth globally. Q1 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China grew 27% on a currency neutral basis fueled by nearly all key categories led by sportswear and Jordan.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Coming off of the FIBA World Cup in China, we are also excited about the energy around the basketball category in this geography and globally as we enter the new NBA season. The impact of digital in China has been nothing short of extraordinary. NIKE digital grew over 70% in Q1, in part amplified by our strategic partnerships with Tmall and WeChat. And looking ahead we are pulling forward the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China into late Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Based on trade and other dynamics we continue to be deeply engaged with all of our constituents in China and we’re also closely monitoring consumer sentiment. At the same time, affinity for the NIKE brand continues to build and our sell-through at retail remains very strong. We believe we're extending the NIKE brand’s leadership in China by remaining authentically focused on serving the Chinese consumer while fueling their passion for sport and a broader movement toward a more active lifestyle.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So now let's turn from China to another fast-growing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis driven by nearly 50% growth in NIKE digital. In Q1, we launched the NIKE App at Retail in our [indiscernible] store, a great example of bringing the consumer direct offense to life globally through the key city of Tokyo.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">The culture of basketball was also driving force behind the momentum we saw in APLA with the Jordan brand growing strong double digits year-over-year. APLA is an extremely entrepreneurial and diverse geography. In APLA we continue testing new concepts with local partners such as our digital commerce relationship with Flipkart in India to leveraging the social media platform Kakao in Korea on the launch of Joyride and on ramping new members.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Finally, at Converse, revenue increased 8% on a currency neutral basis with the Converse brand delivering strong double-digit growth in China and across digital globally, while returning to growth in Europe. Growth is being fueled by an increasingly stronger and diversified product portfolio, including across the Chuck Taylor franchise, the Chuck 70 and the Chuck Taylor Lift. We're also excited about Converse’s reentry into performance basketball, which got off to a great start with the successful launch of the All Star Pro BB.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now turning to our outlook. We see continued momentum going forward. Accordingly, our projected currency neutral growth and profitability are improving. One might have expected the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds to result in lower real dollar expectations; however, our real dollar outlook remains consistent to slightly improved net of all of the dynamics in our business.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">For the full year we continue to expect reported revenue growth within the high single-digit range, slightly exceeding fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth. This incorporates our improved currency neutral outlook being largely offset by the more intense FX headwinds of late associated with trade dynamics.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Recall that the impact of foreign exchange hedges is not accounted for within our revenue line item. We now expect to deliver full year gross margin expansion within the 50 to 75 basis point range. That assumes that the negative impact of recently implemented tariffs remains in effect for the balance of our fiscal year. And again remember that our Q1 gross margin expansion was amplified by timing shifts and other discrete items.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">While our recent acquisition of Celect will have some impact on SG&amp;A, we still expect SG&amp;A to grow roughly in line with revenue for the year. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens. And for OIE, net of interest expense, we continue to expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our focus first and foremost is on sustaining strong currency neutral operating momentum over the full year and longer term, but based on the volatile dynamics of late I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. We expect reported revenue growth in Q2 to be in line with our Q1 reported revenue growth. That assumes our strong currency neutral revenue growth will be dampened by roughly 3 points of FX headwinds. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion to be roughly 25 basis points with slightly greater expansion than that in the second half of the year. The impact of tariffs will be most pronounced in Q2. In Q2, we expect SG&amp;A growth in the high single-digit range. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. And for OIE, we expect income in Q2 to be roughly $10 million to $30 million.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We are extremely pleased with our brand momentum and the strong currency neutral growth we delivered since implementing our new offense two years ago. That said, we are still in the early stages of NIKE strategic transformation. Our execution of the consumer direct offense will continue to fuel growth across our portfolio of key categories, key cities in key countries as well as accelerate our growth against the outside long-term opportunities that we see in women's, apparel, digital and international.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">With that, we’ll now open up the call for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p9"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, guys. Good afternoon.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, Bob.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, Bob.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">I guess the question I have is – two questions really. On the first part of it is in North America, can you talk a little bit more about the apparel performance in terms of some success in women’s but just generally the level of growth and sort of how we should approach that? And the second question is just around the inventory levels, any pockets of concerns there, any areas geographically that you’re concerned about or anything we should think about from that perspective?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. I’ll start on North America apparel. We continue – you asked about women’s in particular, we continue to grow the women’s apparel business in North America. It’s in fact growing at a very strong rate. At the same time we see great opportunity ahead, even greater than we’ve capitalized on to date. Overall, in terms of apparel growth, we’re really pleased with the growth. The number in Q1 does compare unfavorably to some prior year comps. As you may recall last year in Q1, apparel in North America grew 8% and that was in part impacted by the jersey business relative to the NBA. As you may recall, LeBron changed teams last year and that had some impact. We also were seeing this year back-to-school extend a bit out of Q1 and into our Q2. So in short we see really strong demand for our apparel in North America. We’ve had a little bit of pressure on supply but you’re going to see the rates of growth in North America apparel accelerate over the balance of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then you asked about inventory. I guess I’ll take that one too. Inventory as we spoke about was up 12% versus prior year. That was primarily driven by strong consumer demand. A majority of our inventories in new seasonal product, some of which is in transit to the marketplace and we’ll sell in to the marketplace and sell through over the quarter and into Q3. There was also a little bit of an impact from foreign exchange in that inventory number. So if you look at it on a unit basis, our unit inventory growth is really well aligned with our forward-looking unit growth. And kind of combining those two themes, one, the fact that it’s largely seasonal inventory and, two, that the overall unit numbers are aligned with what you’re seeing and you would expect and hope to see is that our closeout mix is low and it is in fact very low. So our inventory is very healthy in our geographies. There are a couple of other dynamics that are probably worth calling out. One, again, is this extended back-to-school season. So you see some of that inventory now selling through as back-to-school extended into September, which is in our Q2. And then we also have been building inventory in anticipation of Singles’ Day on 11.11 in China. So the punch line is we feel great about the inventory that we have on hand and it’s reflective of the strong demand for the brand.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. Operator, next question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Jamie Merriman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks very much for all the color on the call. The first question is with respect to North America and you talked about the decision to purposely ramp down some of those – not strategic partners in the market. Can you talk about how those plans play out for the balance of 2020 and how we should think about that? And then can you just give us an update on how you’re thinking about some of those strategic partners, specifically with e-commerce on whether you have an update on partnerships with Amazon, Jet, partners like that and what you’ve seen so far? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, Jamie. I’ll take the first question relative to North America. As you may recall from our call 90 days ago, we highlighted that we were going to have some year-over-year comparison dynamics in North America. So I’d start by saying we’re right on plan in North America. We’re really pleased with the growth that we’re seeing in that geography. We still see that geography as sustaining strong healthy mid-single digit growth. You’ll see slightly higher growth rates in North America over the balance of the year than what we delivered in Q1 and of course remember not all percents are created equal. A point or two of growth in North America is a pretty significant impact.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then again I think I touched on this a little bit with respect to Bob’s question. The growth in Q1 was slightly impacted again by some year-over-year comparisons not just in the jersey business but also the timing of innovation launches in footwear and then again with that kind of extended back-to-school season spanning over Q1 and into our Q2, which begins in September. So again, we see tremendous momentum in North America.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">You also asked about the distinction between NIKE direct differentiated consumer experiences and undifferentiated consumer experiences. That is really a tale of two cities. We are seeing strong in fact accelerating growth in NIKE digital. We’re seeing high-single digit growth in differentiated retail with our strategic partners. And we’re seeing an expected in fact somewhat intentional and deliberate decline in undifferentiated retail and the drivers of that are how we allocate product and where we put our retail investment dollars. So we would expect that trend to continue in the short term.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Of course, long term our goal is we have reshaped this marketplace to one in which we’re connecting much more directly with NIKE consumers and members through NIKE direct in our strategic wholesale partners. So again, we’re on plan in North America. The brand’s extremely strong and really excited about the opportunities ahead including in those areas we consistently touched on; digital, women’s, core footwear below $100 which is touched on in apparel.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Let me touch on the second question you had on the digital partnerships. Obviously, digital growth is driving much of NIKE’s overall growth and that’s importantly obviously for direct but also the digital base business with our partners both wholesalers who are expanding their growth through the digital channel as well as digital platforms. We don’t have anything new to update you on in terms of Amazon. So far the work with Amazon, the relationship has gone well. The business is performing well that is, so nothing new to report there.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We continue to sort of analyze that relationship and the other opportunities we have from a platform partnership standpoint. It’s really critical that our platform partners are actually serving our members or serving our consumers at the highest level possible so that means sort of seamless interaction, frictionless experiences in terms of commerce, looking at an environment where they know that they’re buying authentic NIKE products and ultimately just to better know and serve our consumers. So those are things that we expect from our digital platform partners.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We feel really good about our partners in Europe and in China and then also growing through the digital channels here in the United States with partners like Instagram through social media, just getting on Jet so there’s lots of opportunity ahead there. So this will be an important part of our growth going forward. And I should mention – I failed to mention one of our biggest most successful partners here is in China and that’s Tmall. So tremendous relationship there, continues to add energy to the brand as well as help to drive our business in China.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Operator, next question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to touch base on the gross margin performance. Perhaps you could just walk through a little bit more detail on the spread versus your original estimates, how we should think about the supply chain impact in 1Q and how that will affect the balance of the quarters as well as what were the drivers behind the lower than expected markdowns and what is the impact in 2Q of tariffs, color on that would be helpful? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure. Thanks, Paul. I will first walk you through some of the impacts or drivers as you said in terms of the spread versus our guidance. So as compared to the expectations we said 90 days ago, 150 basis points significantly exceeded those. I’d say, first, I would touch on higher growth and favorable mix in our international geographies; second, higher growth in our NIKE direct business and again both of those are I would say over-indexing growth versus the plan we had 90 days ago, so strong momentum in those dimensions of our business versus plan. And again, our international geographies are higher margin geographies than North America and our NIKE direct business is a higher margin business than the wholesale business.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">You asked about lower than expected markdowns in our factory store business, I’d say that was most pronounced in Europe. In Europe, we’ve really just had extraordinary separation. You’ve seen strong double-digit currency neutral growth in Europe for quite some time. We’re taking share and our brand’s just incredibly strong in all of our key cities in Europe. So frankly our markdowns were much lower than we had planned there and in some other areas of our business. Not only we planned for the quarter but then you’d expect in a typical quarter. You also asked about the impact of tariffs. Tariffs will impact Q2 through Q4. Now again, we guided to slightly improved overall gross margin even taking into account those tariffs, but the impact is more pronounced in Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">As you know they were announced in August and implemented on September 1. That doesn’t give us much time to manage any of the levers within our overall portfolio. As we look out to the balance of the year, there are a lot of levers within our portfolio. We’ve managed them over time. We’re a big proponent of free and fair trade and that’s because tariffs have always been part of the financial equation in NIKE, so with a little bit of time we have a lot of levers we can work with from sourcing to other levers. So the impact of tariffs is most significant in Q2. And then as you likely inferred from our guidance, we expect slightly greater gross margin expansion in Q3 and Q4 as compared to Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I really appreciate that color. My quick follow up is just regarding the product pipeline. You spoke about a lot of the exciting platforms that are delivering results for you already. Just curious if there’s a way that you could maybe rank for us your excitement or how you think about the platforms and new areas of innovation that will drive these strong high-single digit revenue gains over the balance of the year as we think about Joyride and Air Max now moving to 200, what you’re doing in women’s, just any color on that would be helpful? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes, absolutely. The excitement meter is very high over this next year. We sort of look at the Summer Olympics as term papers due and so we’re – this is the time when we bring our best work not only from a brand standpoint but certainly from a product standpoint. And in this case both performance-based innovation that actually leverages into sport style or sportswear, so we feel like the portfolio of innovation or the pipeline of innovation is more complete. I always talk about the complete offense and that’s how we line up innovation is against our complete offense.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">You mentioned women’s. I would include core in that, more accessibly priced innovation coming particularly in the spring/summer seasons. We’ve got incredible again sportswear. We’ve good performance up in here for a long time at NIKE and some of the most incredible breakthroughs in performance coming for the Tokyo Olympics building on some of the great platforms that we’ve learned how to leverage more completely. That includes the cadence of the innovations, how we manage the lifecycle of innovations and how we again leverage that across multiple categories both in performance and sportswear. So incredibly high level of excitement. I would add we’ve talked about adapt. It’s still in the early stages.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">NIKE Fit will include both the powered adaptive systems as well as non-powered hands free systems and that’s incredibly exciting as we bring innovation to more – make innovation more accessible to more people. Women’s of course will continue to be a high priority. We’re shifting resources to amp up our innovation agenda there, feel really good both footwear and apparel. Kids I mentioned is an incredible category to leverage the innovation that we have more completely across the portfolio, so that’s a major source for us for growth as well. So I think the opportunities ahead are as bright as I’ve ever seen them, so very bullish.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sounds like --</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Operator?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Omar Saad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to ask my first question, another follow up on North America. The 30% DTC growth obviously that’s a huge number, a smaller piece of the business. We talked about that still kind of being offset by the intentional reduction and undifferentiated of the wholesale. If we think about when DTC – kind of the time horizon looking out when the DTC just to become a material mover for the overall North American market or you get to a point where you’re happy with kind of the wholesale footprint. And then I have another follow up for Mark as well. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, Omar, we at our Investor Day a couple of years ago talked about our business being 30% or greater digital, owned and partnered over the next five years. That’s a global measure of success, but I would say North America is in that same range in terms of the [indiscernible]. So we see digital alone not necessarily all of NIKE direct, but digital alone being in that range. And as we’ve discussed we see that continuing to build beyond that and potentially accelerating towards that date based on the incredible momentum that we’ve had.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">As I noted, that was an accelerated level of growth in NIKE digital in Q1. So much like we discussed at our Investor Day two years ago, our view is that over the next five years, sustainable profitable growth in North America would equate to a mid-single digit range of growth. But what we’re really excited about is we think the next five years in North America is building the platform for the long term future. North America is the marketplace where the most reshaping and transformation is required and frankly is underway.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Omar Saad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Got it. And then stepping back, I don’t think and watching the different components of the company perform year-after-year or quarter-after-quarter, I’ve never seen such consistent positive performance across categories, regions, price points, channels, age groups, genders. Maybe help us understand – NIKE obviously performed exceptionally in the past, but maybe if you can help us understand or give us some insight into why that kind of broader platform seems to be performing so much more consistently than it has historically? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I think we’re actually a lot smarter about how we – not only where we invest in terms of new product innovation but as I said we better leverage that innovation across multiple categories and then up and down the price point spectrum across genders. Again, I was fixated on complete offense and it’s one of those areas where you go no matter how well we’re doing across all those dimensions, we see more opportunity areas where we have – we are underpenetrated where we have what we call outsized opportunities. We’ve talked about apparel. We’ve talked about women’s, digital, international as examples.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">But even in our foundational business I think we’ve got tremendous upside ahead in terms of core. Striking that right balance across the complete portfolio or the complete offense as we call it is never ending challenge for us or opportunity, let me put it that way. So the innovation that we’re putting out there I think we’re just getting better at how we’re leveraging that across the entire offense. And I feel like this has always been a competitive advantage for NIKE as the source of brand energy but also tremendous growth for us and I’ve never seen or been at NIKE during a period where there’s such robust and strong innovation that’s relevant to consumers across the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">That said, I’d be the first one as people here at NIKE would tell you to say that we have a lot more opportunity. So the challenge or the opportunity is to focus on the things that matter the most. We have unlimited opportunities. The fixation or the focus on the things that are really going to drive the needle from a consumer standpoint that are really going to be relevant and ultimately drive growth is what creates success.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Omar I’d just add maybe from a framework perspective or framing of how you might think about it, our key categories in our 12 key cities and our 10 key countries are really the where in terms of growth opportunity is for NIKE. The consumer direct offense is the how and it applies to all of those categories, all those cities and all those countries and that’s about doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, being faster to market so that’s 2x speed and then being more directly connected to consumers. And there isn’t any dimension of our offense, the complete offense that Mark refers to, that isn’t [indiscernible] can be positively impacted by those strategic principles.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then of course the overarching or maybe you’d say underlying fuel is this digital transformation of NIKE, it’s impacting everything we do from how we create product to how we assess demand and plan supply all the way through to consumer services through the NIKE app that are now not just in our digital offerings but in our retail stores and increasingly in our partner doors. So it’s really a strategy the consumer racked off in the sense of that, impacting every dimension of the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, I want to put an exclamation point on that. The digital capabilities that we’re creating and investing in are really going to make us a better innovation company understanding the consumer, serving the consumer, leveraging the innovation that we invest in, it’s all making us better. I see so much more opportunity from advancing our digital capabilities going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Operator, maybe we have time for one more call.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple of questions from me on the gross margin. Andy, as we think about gross margin in the context of historical performance, you’ve got pricing power afforded by innovations, structural shifts from outgrowth of direct, you’re reshaping the North American marketplace and then some more nuance factors that can help margin like leveraging Celect and NIKE Fit and so forth. Is there a reason to think that NIKE gross margin shouldn’t go past peaks in the near future? It seems like a lot of good things are coming together.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">The short answer is no. I think many of the drivers you mentioned and some others are long-term drivers of expansion in margin. NIKE direct is a significantly higher margin business than the wholesale business and as we just touched on as part of Omar’s question, we see digital and direct being increasingly larger part of our business long term. The price value equation is also an opportunity to expand margin.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And as Mark just touched on, we’ve never been more excited about the innovation pipeline we’re bringing to market and that means bringing tangible value to the consumer. In your own question you touched on a huge opportunity. At our Investor Day we talked about the potentially significant impact from having a greater mix of full-price sell through and lower markdowns and closeout, and Celect is just spot on in terms of the capabilities that we had planned to build organically but are now able to start leveraging, thanks to this acquisition and drive that.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">If I was to tell you the one thing that we’re not as pleased about are the FX headwinds that have impacted us. As I touched on, on the call over the last four years we’ve had about $3 billion headwind on revenue and $1.5 billion more headwind on profitability. Of course, if we could add this back we would. That would be a pretty significant expansion in our operating margin that’s more reflective of what we’re doing from an operating perspective. But again, the short answer is yes. We see some pretty systemic drivers of gross margin expansion over the short, medium and long term.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And then as it relates to FX and gross margin, to what extent are more favorable hedge rates a positive contributor to gross margin in the first quarter and fiscal '20?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes, the way I would think about FX in fiscal year '20 is we came into the year expecting FX to be sort of neutral to slightly favorable. It’s now a net negative from an EBIT perspective. Again that’s in the context of our slightly improved guidance, so we are thrilled that our operational performance just continues to be so strong that it’s offsetting that. Over the balance of the year one thing to keep in mind is it’s somewhat difficult to predict – not to predict but to model the impact of FX.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">You have very volatile actual spot rates. Certainly the Renminbi is at the top of the list in that regard of late. The timing of our hedges over the course of the year as well as the timing which is kind of backward looking timing aspect in terms of when we lock in product costs. So I think that the easiest way for me to say it is, FX will be about 3 points negative headwind on revenue as I spoke about in my guidance. It will be a slightly negative impact on margin over the course of the full fiscal year and it’s now shifted to a slightly negative impact from an EBIT perspective.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">We’re hopeful that those are more transient impacts. And that as we go forward and we get more certainty with respect to trade and some resolution that maybe we see things turn from a headwind into a tailwind.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.</p>]"

Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Mark Parker</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon everyone. NIKE delivered strong results in fiscal year '19 growing 11% on a currency neutral basis, which outpaced our expectations from the beginning of the year. Our results are further proof that the demand for sport performance and athletic lifestyle product is thriving and our consumer direct offense is capturing more of that opportunity every day. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">What's most exciting is that we delivered broad-based growth through our complete portfolio. We saw that balance across our geographies, men's and women's and key categories. Overall fiscal '19 was the defining year for NIKE as we accelerated the high-impact capabilities of innovation, direct and speed that fuel our triple-double. Innovation continues to win with consumers not only in performance product but also in sportswear. In fiscal '19 new innovation platforms drove roughly 100% of our total incremental growth, which is exceeding the long-term target we laid out at Investor Day 2017. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">In digital we know we're just getting started. NIKE is accelerating our digital advantage and that focus led to 35% digital revenue growth. Speed remains an incredible opportunity, and we're well on our way towards cutting our product creation cycle in half and we're investing in responsive manufacturing, connected inventory and optimizing data to capitalize on real-time consumer demand. And finally throughout the year, our brand connected emotionally with a wider audience in more meaningful ways. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our triple-double, our focus on the triple-double is especially important in an environment like we're in right now, where geopolitical dynamics have led to trade tensions and foreign exchange volatility. We’re certainly mindful of the risks, and more importantly we're in command of the conditions that are under our control. And that's serving the consumer and managing the leverage we have, delivering great products, engaging experiences and building our brand. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our greater China business is the blueprint for how all those dimensions come together. We added more than $1 billion of incremental growth in the geography over this past year. We are and remain a brand of China and for China. NIKE is proud of the investments we've made and the relationships we've developed in energizing this marketplace. We're confident that we will continue to grow sport and our business in China for decades to come. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now let's go deeper on the three capabilities that are NIKE's greatest catalysts for growth, and that's innovation, direct and speed. And I'll start with innovation. The consumer continues to tell us they want innovation to perform better as well as innovation that creates distinctions in their lifestyle product. Refueling that demand with styles like the Max 270, VaporMax and Max 720 which were amongst NIKE's top volume drivers for the year. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">The React platform too, expanded into sportswear led by the React Element 55, 87 and the Presto. In both React and Air innovations helped fuel sportswear to another 20% plus growth quarter in Q4. Looking ahead to fiscal year '20 we see great opportunity for both platforms to continue to carve out new space in the lifestyle markets. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">In performance footwear, basketball accelerated in Q4. The greatest growth continues to come from NIKE's own digital platforms where we have the most direct connection with the passionate basketball consumer. And signature shoes continue to lead the way, with KD, LeBron and KYRIE all growing double digits. And next month were looking forward to adding another exciting personality to the mix with the addition of Giannis and his first signature collection following his incredible MVP season. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">The Jordan Brand had a very strong year growing 12%. Jordan returned to a poor market in North America after we reset the marketplace earlier in the year. The Air Jordan 1 continues to be a global phenomenon, as we see success in both High Heat and In Line [ph] styles. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">In China we see a healthy balance between Jordan Lifestyle and performance product and we know there's still more opportunity for performance footwear in all geos. The new chapters of the Jordan growth story, apparel, women's and international are showing great potential. It's hard to overstate how important this year has been to the evolution of the women's offense at NIKE. The business grew double digits in fiscal ’19, accelerating in the back half of the year. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our momentum in women's a great example of how our renewed focus is really moving the needle through thoughtful designs, powerful brand messages, and digitally led distribution. You're obviously seeing it now with all the energy around World Cup. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">To start the tournament nearly two-thirds of the teams wore NIKE kits and half the players wear our boots. The exposure is driving outstanding sell through in kits, high performance bras and lifestyle extensions. In fact, the USA Women's home jersey is now the number one soccer jersey men's or women's ever sold on NIKE.com in one season. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">For me personally, the groundswell of support around the world for the athletes and teams has been truly inspiring. Tomorrow, all eyes are going to be on the U.S. versus France. I know I can't wait to watch these two NIKE teams in what should be one of the top matches of the tournament. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">We're equally focused on delivering for the everyday athletes as we continue to fuel the broader movement of health and wellness around the world. Across the portfolio, we're serving women in more dimensions. This quarter we claimed the number one position in market share for bras in North America for the first time in NIKE’s history. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Through [indiscernible], and women's specific sneakers like the Air Max Dia, we fueled sportswear, footwear and apparel to strong double digit growth this quarter. And we're expanding our inclusive size and collections with over 90 styles across run, train and live. And later this year we’ll unveil geography specific women's apparel for the Asian market based on our research of body types and sizes. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">One question I get asked a lot is how we plan to accelerate the growth in our Women's Business? In addition to the right product and inspirational brand experiences, the major unlock we see over the next several years is the opportunity that digital provides. Distribution is often one of our biggest barriers. And we continue to find that when we present product in a more future forward way, we’re able to take the female consumer someplace new. And they're responding. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our Women's Business in NIKE Direct and through our digital platforms continues to outpace our performance in the wholesale channels. Digital and where digital meets physical will be tremendous sources of growth in women's moving forward. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Another massive opportunity that we continue to obsess is apparel. At NIKE we have a number of advantages in our favor that we leverage. We work with the best athletes, leagues and federations and we celebrate them through moments like the World Cup, leagues like the NBA and partnerships like Jordan and PSG. We have multiple categories that surface deep consumer insights. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our apparel businesses this quarter grew double digits across basketball, training, and women's. And we have a world class design team that connects culture to sport in very creative ways. In fiscal year ‘19 we grew NIKE sportswear apparel over 20% into an over $3 billion business. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">With our core footwear business, we've talked about the importance of refreshing our collections for today's demanding consumer. Looking ahead, we're doing that with a steady flow of new core footwear that features Air Max and Zoom Air and we will introduce more innovation in the space. One example being our Renew platform. You'll also see added retail support from many of the new collections in this price range.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As we start fiscal ’20, we're reloading with new platforms that will shape our innovation agenda for years to come. This week, we launched the new shoe that merges two of our most celebrated platforms, the Air Max React 270. And we have more hybrids in footwear on the way for the next several seasons. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the end of Q1 we’ll unveil Joyride, which is a platform that I'm incredibly excited about. This new approach to cushioning will deliver a more personalized feeling for runners at every level. I've been wearing different versions over the last year, and it's extremely comfortable. We think the design has great potential to stand out with the consumer in both performance and lifestyle.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And finally, as we head into the back half of the fiscal year, we'll give full view into NIKE'S innovation pipeline for the Tokyo Olympics. We'll evolve 4%, a shoe that dominated metal stands [ph] into what we call next percent, which will deliver even greater measurable benefits to more athletes. You'll see sustainability that plays an even more elevated role in our design. And we'll deliver collections with more commercial potential than any other Olympics in our history.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As we look ahead, these innovations will serve as the foundation for NIKE products and collections well into fiscal '21 and beyond. These platforms are the launchpad for the future growth of our company.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Fiscal year '19 was also a year that we saw NIKE accelerate our digital advantage. I noted earlier that the 2X Direct is catalyzing our growth. Within Direct its digital, within digital, it's mobile. And within mobile, it's our apps. And all of this leverages and builds membership.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our investments are enabling us to identify and better serve our members personally, which is driving higher consumer lifetime value. We've just passed 170 million total members in the NIKE Plus ecosystem ahead of the pace we communicated at Investor Day.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The sneakers app has become an incredible asset to our brand, with users checking in daily, and has acquired more new members than any other digital channel for NIKE. For the fiscal year, sneakers more than doubled his business, doubled its number of monthly active users, and now accounts for roughly 20% of our overall digital business.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The NIKE app, our most comprehensive one stop shop for NIKE products is quickly expanding with triple digit revenue growth in Q4. And in the first half of fiscal year '20, we will launch the NIKE app in China and in 13 new markets in EMEA. This will be an incredible addition to our business through a potential pool of hundreds of millions of new members.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The digital opportunity alone is tremendous. But just as promising is how digital and physical environments are intersecting and amplify each other. Our most effective test case thus far has been the NIKE app at retail, which links features of the NIKE app to our physical retail experiences. The NIKE app at retail is live in over 30 doors across the U.S., the UK and France. And we'll be scaling considerably throughout fiscal year '20, including in select factory stores.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">A few of the insights that we gained in our early pilots are that physical retail can be an exponential driver of membership. Product scans in-store often fuel online purchases later. And in-store exclusive offers through mobile tend to drive higher conversion rates and outsized spending. We're in the early stages of this elevated way of serving the consumer in our own environments. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">At the same time, we're moving quickly to scale these features and connecting inventory with our wholesale partners. A stronger use of digital and physical retail is everyone's opportunities. Seamless, frictionless shopping is what the consumer expects today. This quarter, we introduced a new digital concept to address one of the most significant problems consumers face. And that's sizing in footwear. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our solution NIKE Fit scans the foot either through your smartphone camera, or through an in-store experience. We believe a more accurate understanding of a consumer size will not only minimize returns, reduce costs and drive healthier growth, the insights we gain will also improve the way NIKE designs and manufactures product. We're excited to roll out NIKE Fit in the U.S. and EMEA later in 2019. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our success through digital also relies on getting product to market faster. One way, we do that is through more responsive manufacturing. This summer we're making a significant investment in our manufacturing capabilities with an additional NIKE Air manufacturing center here in the United States. The consumer demand for NIKE Air is currently outpacing supply. This investment will help us better meet that demand and accelerate new innovations for one of our most distinct platforms. We will have more details coming in July. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">We also continue to build our capabilities in data and analytics, digital demand sensing and connected inventory to create a supply chain that anticipates and response to shifts in consumers demand quickly. Beginning in Q1, we placed RFID in nearly all NIKE footwear and apparel, which is hundreds of millions of products. RFID gives us the most complete view of our inventory that we have ever had. It's quickly becoming the most precise tool in our arsenal to meet an individual consumer specific need at the exact right moment. We will go live with this capability in Q1 across 20 NIKE Direct stores and then continue to scale across the fleet. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our sharper understanding of what's selling will also continue to inform our express lane, which is already driving higher full price sell through and better gross margins. In EMEA the Express Lane now totals over 20% of their business. A smarter use of data is also providing even more value to our most engaged NIKE consumers. One new model we're testing offers concept car footwear innovation from NIKE's leading designers to our most valued members in North America. This is a great opportunity to leverage member insights to serve them better and inform which products to scale. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Finally, 2019 was a year in which the NIKE brand rose above and connected emotionally with consumers on another level. We broke through with a number of Just Do It campaigns that’s celebrated our athlete's strengths. Over the course of fiscal '19, Just Do It generated an unprecedented 1.5 billion consumer engagements across our geographies and versus last year Google search volume for the words NIKE and Just Do It increased well over 100%. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">This quarter we also released our Impact Report showing the various ways that NIKE is taking meaningful action to protect the future of sport. We're working with communities of young people to increase activity with programs like Made to Play that reach 16 million kids. And we are investing in the training of over 100,000 coaches this year to mentor girls worldwide.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We're also minimizing our environmental footprint with a target of 100% renewable energy globally by 2025. We are driving sustainability at scale through recycled material in our aerosols, which is diverting 50 million pounds of waste from landfills each year. These are the kinds of steps and transparency that consumers expect today and as we share our stories we're bringing even more dimensions and value to the NIKE brand. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">NIKE itself, in making amazing products, inspiring through an iconic brand and leading through digital advantage. We're pushing the pace in all three facets and ended up with a formula for creating strong shareholder value. We're proud of the results our team delivered in fiscal '19, but more importantly, with an earnest future were confident that NIKE is investing in the right areas to extend our competitive advantage and continue to deliver sustained growth over the long-term. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">With that here's Andy. </p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Andy Campion</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone on the call. As we close fiscal year '19 and we look ahead to fiscal year '20 three key themes stand out from the financial perspective. First NIKE is a growth company. Growth is how we measure the value we're creating for consumers and growth is paramount in terms of how NIKE creates value for shareholders. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Second, NIKE's growth is being fueled by strategic transformation. Transformation is about deliberately driving acceleration toward what you aspire to be in the future, not about just extrapolating what you are today. Accordingly, transformation requires innovation, it requires continuous learning and it requires investment. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Third, especially in times of geopolitical and FX volatility NIKE's currency neutral financial performance provides a clear view into our fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create extraordinary value for our shareholders. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's first go a little deeper on growth. At our Investor Day in October 2017, we said that our new consumer direct offense would generate high single digit revenue growth on average over the next five years. In our first full year executing this new strategy we accelerated out of the box, with growth in fiscal year '19 that exceeded expectations. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">For the full year NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 11% on a currency neutral basis and 10% in the most recent quarter. At NIKE Scale that is roughly $4 billion of incremental revenue in just one year. Our growth is also broad-based with all four geographies growing at or above the long-term targets that we communicated for each geography at our Investor Day. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Now that brings me to the second key theme. Our growth is being fueled by a strategic transformation of NIKE globally. At our investor day we said that over the next five years, we aspire to double the cadence and impact of innovation, to operate with greater speed and agility and to double our direct connection to consumers, leading with digital. These three pillars of our strategy were designed to drive global transformation and growth across our 12 key cities and 10 key countries. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">To help gauze the quality and impact of our growth, we also communicated several key measures of success. Today we are on pace to exceed on all of those measures. Take for example innovation. In fiscal year '19, we've already doubled the percentage of total revenue generated by recently launched innovation platforms as compared to fiscal year '17. We are delivering 2X innovation by prioritizing investment in platforms like React and Air that have greater potential to scale across both performance in sportswear.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As for Direct we are also ahead of pace, NIKE Direct drove roughly 50% of our incremental revenue growth in fiscal year '19, with NIKE digital growing 35% for the full year. Digital commerce own and partnered is on track to comprise at least 30% of our business by 2023. And longer-term we see digital driving the majority of our business. This kind of transformational growth doesn't happen by accident transformation requires investment. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">In fiscal year '19, we invested over $1 billion in new capabilities and consumer concepts that include significant investment in the sneakers app, the NIKE app, new store concepts leveraging digital, our NIKE Plus membership platform and enterprise wide data and analytics capabilities that are helping us serve NIKE consumers in new and better ways. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">With these long-term focused transformational investments, equating to nearly all of our incremental SG&amp;A versus prior year we're clearly also editing and shifting within our legacy expenditures. As for the sneakers app we acquired Virgin Mega two years ago, a little over two years ago and have since invested organically in the team, digital tools, content creation and the geographic rollout of sneakers into 22 countries, and the returns on our investment has been extraordinary. The sneakers app that has accelerated from less than $70 million in revenue in fiscal year '16 to an annual run rate of over $750 million based on Q4 fiscal year '19 performance. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">We also invested significantly in the NIKE app. The NIKE app has extraordinary growth potential offering broader mobile access to NIKE's portfolio of products. In North America, NIKE app revenue is growing triple digits and we're just starting to roll out globally. As Mark mentioned, we'll launch the NIKE app in greater China in fiscal year '20. We're also investing in new store concepts that leverage digital including our two new houses innovation in New York and Shanghai and the smaller digitally enhanced format NIKE Live. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">These store concepts are exceeding plan revenue as they bring to life new ways of serving the consumer through the use of the NIKE app at retail. That brings me to the six significant investments we're making in our NIKE Plus membership platform. These investments have been largely organic, focused on building capabilities that help us know our consumers better to serve them in new ways. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">That said, we also acquired both Zodiac and Invertex roughly one year ago, to accelerate our membership offense. Zodiac has accelerated our ability to measure the impact of targeted service and product offerings on an individual's consumer lifetime value. While Invertex brought us computer visioning and volumetric based data and analytics that helped us create and bring NIKE Fit to market within just one year. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">As I said earlier, the third key theme from a financial perspective is that in times like these, NIKE's currency neutral financial performance, offers a clear reflection of NIKE's fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create value for shareholders. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">18 months ago, it appeared that harmonized global growth was beginning to turn foreign exchange into a slight tailwind for NIKE. However, geopolitical dynamics over the past year have led to dollar strengthening fueled largely by uncertainty around Brexit and U.S. China trade. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">So within fiscal year ‘19, alone, dollar strengthening drove FX headwinds of over $1.4 billion on our reported revenue versus our plan entering fiscal year ‘19 and nearly $300 million in EBIT after taking into account our hedges. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">We know that the foreign exchange headwinds of late may be transient. So we've remained primarily focused on the levers we can control in executing our strategy. And you see that in our currency neutral performance. Our strong currency neutral growth and margin expansion reflect NIKE's brand heat and distinction in North America and in all key international markets. The strength of our product portfolio and the transformation we're driving in the marketplace leveraging digital. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our SG&amp;A growth in fiscal year '19 was a function of accelerating the investments required to drive transformation while gaining leverage in our core legacy expenditures. We are editing and shifting to gain leverage most notably within our geographies, where we're creating differentiated consumer experiences leveraging digital while optimizing on differentiated retail. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">That includes, for example, shifting many wholesale customers to what we call NIKE.net, an efficient digital platform for buying at wholesale. We're also testing new digital business models with respect to off price sales and optimizing our NIKE factory store fleet. Over the next three years, as we scaled it digital and drive more focused growth, we will increasingly edit and shift resources in targeted areas. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">One key financial measure that reflects NIKE's unrivaled ability to turn strategic investment into competitive advantage and growth is return on invested capital. In fiscal year ’19 NIKE’s industry leading adjusted ROIC expanded over 400 basis points. Going forward, we see continued strong growth, expanding margins, and high returns on invested capital as we drive strategic transformation at NIKE through the consumer direct offense. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">But before I share outlook for fiscal year '20 let's briefly touch on our strong Q4 results. NIKE Inc. Q4 revenue increased 4% on reporting real dollar basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, with both meaningfully exceeding the expectations we communicated 90 days ago. For the full year NIKE Inc. revenue increased 7.5% on a reported basis, as strong 11% currency neutral growth was partially offset by FX headwinds. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Gross margin expanded 80 basis points in Q4, also exceeding our guidance. Margin expansion was driven by strong full price sales, enhanced product profitability and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year gross margins expanded 90 basis points. SG&amp;A grew 9% in Q4, and 10% for the full year as we drove brand distinctions, and heat through the Just Do It Dream cape crazy campaigns and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, while accelerating our investment in NIKE's digital transformation. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter, and 16.1% for the full year, slightly above our guidance driven by earnings mix and quarterly volatility associated with the continuing impacts of U.S. tax reform. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.62 and full year diluted EPS increased to $2.49. As of May 31 inventories were up 7% reflecting continued strong full price sell through and tight supply and supported strong forward looking demand. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now let's turn to the financial performance for our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 8% on a currency neutral basis with NIKE Digital leading all channels have strong double-digits.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Well, NIKE Digital continues to power our growth. NIKE is also growing double-digit and gaining significant share with our strategic wholesale partners. That includes strong double-digit growth for NIKE within Foot Locker, Dick's Sporting Goods and Nordstrom. Growth and share gains within these leading wholesale partners reflect NIKE's branding distinction in North America, and the strength of our product portfolio. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our footwear innovation continues to resonate and in apparel we see very strong demand. In some classifications so strong that it's putting pressure on our supply short-term. For the full year, North America's revenue increased 7%, amplified by strong gross margin expansion. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now let's move to EMEA where the NIKE brand continues to lead and drive meaningful separation. Revenue grew 9% in EMEA on a currency neutral basis in Q4, driven by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct across footwear and apparel and in all territories. In EMEA, the NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We're the number one brand in all five key cities in this region. And as we speak, we're creating an even deeper emotional connection to consumers through the Woman's World Cup in France. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">NIKE Digital continues to lead in EMEA, up 35% in the fourth quarter. Yet EMEA is another market where we are truly just getting started. As Mark mentioned, we will more fully leverage the power of mobile, launching the NIKE App into 13 additional countries in fiscal year '20. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">The strength of the NIKE brand in EMEA is also translating into strong double-digit growth and significant share gains with our strategic wholesale partners, most notably JD and Zalando. Note that our strong overall growth in EMEA in Q4 was also comping strong football apparel growth in the prior year fueled by the men's World Cup. For the full year, currency neutral revenue grew 11% and was amplified by strong gross margin expansion. On a reported basis, fiscal year '19 revenue grew 6%. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Next, let's turn to Greater China, which grew 22% on a currency neutral basis in Q4. This marks the 20 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in China. Growth was broad based across men's and women's performance in sportswear and led by digital.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">NIKE digital grew 37% in Q4, fueled by the sneakers app and the strength of NIKE branded experiences with partners such as Tmall and WeChat. For the full year revenue in Greater China increase 24% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, FY19 revenue was up 21%. We see continued strong growth in China in fiscal year '20. As a brand of China for China, we are building deep and meaningful relationships with the Chinese consumer. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">We're investing in our local team and talent, creating products specifically designed for the Chinese consumer, sponsoring China's top athletes federations and team and working closely with the Ministry of Sport and Education to fuel the passion for an increasing participation in sport and fitness in China. On that note, we're excited to amplify consumer's passion for basketball around the FIBA World Cup coming to China in Q1. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">Let's turn to APLA, where Q4 revenue grew 9% of the currency neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all territories. NIKE is a number one favorite brands in all 3 of our key cities in this diverse geographies, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City. NIKE is also the leading brand in Southeast Asia growing strong double-digits. Our growth in APLA is led by digital fueled by the entrepreneurial mindset we're taking with digital partners such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Looking ahead to fiscal year '20, we will signify expand out our NIKE own digital footprint through the scaling of our app eco system. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">For the full fiscal year APLA revenue increased 13% on a currency neutral basis and 2% on a reported basis, and finally at Converse fiscal year '19 revenue increased 3% on a currency neutral basis and 1% on a reported basis, fueled by China and Converse's new digital commerce platform. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Looking forward, we have a new energized leadership team at Converse focused on fueling growth through product diversification, including reigniting Converse's authentic brand positioning in basketball. And that begin with the launch of the All-Star Pro BB basketball shoe in Q4. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">With that let's turn to our outlook for fiscal year '20. Our taxes intensified over the past couple of months, creating more of a headwind on a reported basis, then we envision when we spoke with you last quarter. That said, our currency neutral outlook continues to improve taking these offsetting dynamics into account, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year '20. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our outlook for full-year reported revenue growth remains in the high single-digit range slightly exceeding our reported revenue growth in fiscal year '19. We expect another year of broad-based growth with all four geographies delivering on our long-term financial model. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">As for gross margin we expect expansion potentially approaching 50 basis points. To be clear, we see continued strong operational margin expansion that would otherwise exceed our long-term financial model but for two items, foreign exchange, and strategic supply chain investments such as RFID and expanding Air manufacturing innovation will create a roughly 50 basis points headwind on margin. That headwind is factored in to our guidance. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">As for SG&amp;A we currently expect strategic investment, offset by productivity initiatives to result in very slight SG&amp;A leverage in fiscal year '20. SG&amp;A should eventually grow in line with revenue growth. As for OIE net interest expense we expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year. We see our effective tax rate, in the mid to high teens range. That said we expect continued quarterly volatility based on the publishing of guidance relative to U.S. tax reform and other discrete items. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our primary focus is on the full-year and long-term. However, I'll provide a few specifics with respect to dynamics impact in Q1. In Q1 we expect reported revenue growth in line to slightly above our reported revenue growth in Q4. We expect currency neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range, offset by four points of the FX headwinds. Based on current FX rates the FX impact on revenue should largely abate from Q2 forward. It's also worth noting that in Q1 of fiscal year 19, we were already scaling React and Air Max 270 which had been launched in late fiscal year '18. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now in fiscal year '20 we will launch Joyride at the tail end of Q1 with scale and the launch of other new innovative products coming from Q2 forward. As for gross margin we expect to deliver flat to potentially 25 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q1. This reflects very strong underlying margin expansion fueled by NIKE direct growth and strong full price sales. That said FX will be an anomaly with gross margin in Q1. FX will be a 50 to 70 basis points headwind based on year-over-year foreign exchange rates, which moved significantly within Q1 of last year, as well as the timing of our hedge gains and losses. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">Assuming current rates we expect the impact of FX on margin to be much less material over the balance of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">As for SG&amp;A we're projecting growth in the high single digit range in line with the rate of currency neutral revenue growth. As for OIE net of interest expense we expect roughly $0 to $15 million of income in Q1 and we see our effective tax rate in the mid to high teens range in Q1. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">As we enter fiscal year '20 we are poised for another year of strong sustainable profitable growth and value creation. The NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We have a robust pipeline of innovation to bring to market. And we will continue to strategically transform NIKE and extend our digital advantage. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">With that will now open up the call for questions. </p>, <p class=""p p10"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, sorry. It's been a long day. I guess just the first question I have is on China, I was just wondering if you could, go a little deeper in terms of strength of basketball and China apparel running. And just sort of what you see on the ongoing basis with the strong results and your expectation. I think you said continued growth the next decade. Just are you seeing any pressure there from the consumer around American brand? </p>, <p class=""p p10"">It doesn't appear so in the numbers, but I just wonder if anything's changing, from that perspective. And just wondering if you could maybe just update us a little bit on how you guys are thinking about, some of the trade discussions that continue to unfold here in the U.S. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great, thanks for the question, Bob. Firstly, your first question, which was around the drivers of growth in China categorically. The short answer is over the course of fiscal year ‘19. All categories real growth in China with the exception of global football, and that relates to the comp versus last year's World Cup. The primary drivers of growth of the biggest drivers of growth. We're making sportswear, basketball, Jordan, running group training, but in general, extremely broad based across men's and women's and while led by digital, also broad based across the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then to your question about seeing impact from the U.S. China dynamics of late we have not seen any impact on our business to-date. And we continue to see strong momentum as we enter fiscal year ‘20. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">The consumer sentiment around NIKE in China has been actually quite strong. We've made a lot of effort through the years to connect with the marketplace to take insights to use to drive innovation and messaging that is really, as we said, urban for China. So we're seeing that continue. And it's showing up in the results. I'm really proud of the team in China, we have and the complete offense kind of results that we're seeing coming out of China.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And just on basketball. I just wonder if I could just zone in on a follow up. But it sounds as if NIKE has capitalized on the NBA jersey opportunity, recently created by designer RJ Barrett, ahead of the NBA free agency, what raw material colors have you guys staged, blue and orange or purple and gold? Can you just give us some insight in terms of how you’re positioning for this weekend and the next few weeks?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Good one. Okay. You obviously figured out March [ph] in my hometown? Yeah. Right. You got the coast covered? Well, okay. We got the spectrum covered -- the color spectrum. So we're ready for anything, certainly blue and orange, and purple and gold. But, yeah. No other insights other than I think we got the bases covered. Yeah. Thanks Bob. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. Good luck. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, operator we’ll take the next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Your next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Lauren Cassel </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great, thanks so much. Could you maybe quantify the impact that the supply chain investments had on gross margin during the fourth quarter? And then my second question is just where do we sit here at the end of the fiscal year in terms of your manufacturing exposure to China? What percentage of that is coming into the U.S.? And then just any, any commentary on -- if he wouldn't raise prices, et cetera, should this go through?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I'll take your first question on supply chain investments. The short answer is roughly 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. And just to clarify, those, that is because we capture investments that may be for the long term and our other cost of goods sold within margin. So it can be somewhat distorted in terms of current quarter product profitability. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And Lauren, your second question again, sorry, was pricing levers with respect to China is that… </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Lauren Cassel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah just the current manufacturing exposure to China? I think you guys have been, actively sort of trying to diversify just where do we sit at the end of the year and how much of that is coming into the U.S.?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure, I'll take that one as well. We, we continue to source product in China. We continue to source product in China. We do externally report that we produce about a quarter of our product in China for the globe. Our exposure in terms of product produced in China to North America is relatively modest. At the same time we see a great opportunity to continue and potentially expand the production of product in China, for China and for other markets. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">The short of it is we've got a relatively agile approach to sourcing multiple nodes from a production and distribution perspective. And so while the dynamics are certainly -- while it is certainly dynamic out there with respect to trade, we're relatively well positioned as we always have been for macro dynamics. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And we see China continuing to be a critical part of our source space. For China, but also other parts of the world that will continue. Thank you, Lauren. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Lauren Cassel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you so much. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Operator will take the next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions, I appreciate it. So of course, I want to talk a bit. We -- there -- clearly your currency neutral results were quite strong here, actually, very strong. There were indications of weakness elsewhere in Southwest in the United States. The question I have on that is, as you look at the data closer than we could, was there any more -- were there any more top line challenges through the period that maybe not been totally reflected in the aggregate results?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">One challenge from a top line perspective is frankly a nice problem to have, Brian, which is, as we enter the year we've got a particularly strong demand. Its broad based and a couple of years where we have very strong demand relate to Air, NIKE AIR, which is obviously a distinctive innovation relative to NIKE. So to your point about dynamics out there in the marketplace, we've got an innovation that is obviously closely tied to and really powerful within our portfolio that being NIKE AIR. And as Mark mentioned, in his remarks, we are actually expanding our investment in Air manufacturing in the U.S., and that is directly related to demand that we weren't able to fully capture in the second half of this past year. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">In other areas and apparel got very strong growth in apparel. And we're ramping up supply with respect to a few classifications where our revenue growth could have been greater based on the demand in the marketplace, particularly around fleece. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then just overall, when we speak about our growth, we said that it's not really an extrapolation. It's not really just a correlation to what's going on in the market. It's about a transformation in NIKE. And most notably, that transformation is being fueled by innovation. So we're creating something new and different in the marketplace and digital. Again, we're creating something new and different in the marketplace in terms of the digital connection we have with consumers. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">A couple of other areas I call out quickly. There's the performance has actually been very strong. But I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. I mentioned women's and how we have double-digit growth for the year and it's been accelerating through the fourth quarter. But we're actually very bullish on the opportunity in women's going forward as we move into fiscal '20. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then also called out core product under $100 price point products within footwear. And we have a whole refresh coming in the sort of core zone, not only with existing technologies being leveraged in that space, but unique design work that is going to refresh about 75% of that the styles in that product zone for NIKE. So that's going to create some more opportunity for us.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Nagel </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">That's all. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you, Brian.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Nagel </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I appreciate the detail. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">All right. Operator, we'll take our next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Omar Saad </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually, I wanted to ask first about your comments on RFID inventory, sharing the inventory in the wholesale channel. Kind of wondering what you're thinking about longer term, how you see inventory and inventory management evolving. What the opportunities are to either manage it differently, especially as you talk about matching kind of more diverse consumer demand more accurately? </p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then my second question on the SNKRS app, obviously explosive growth there. How do you think about as you scale that platform, I don’t know the saturation is the right word but how do you keep that growing and also keep it special and did you see, how big is that runway to create those unique experience for consumers through that platform before it starts to lose the special? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Let me just touch on the RFID question first Omar. As I mentioned you were launching RFID across essentially we're in apparel beginning in the fall '19 season and that’s going to enable all the footwear, the majority I should say of non-licensed apparel, through RFID and there QR technology. So that’s a big upside for us in terms of our capability to dramatically improve our inventory visibility and accuracy. I think across the marketplace and throughout the supply chain. And ultimately that's going to allow us to serve consumers with the product that they want, when they want it. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">So the consumer up upside on this is actually quite powerful. And then we're going to rollout through fiscal '20 and scale the capabilities that we have within RFID globally across our own doors and over time I think we see RFID is a key capability throughout owned and partner retail supply chains. So I think this will help us create the capability to grow profitably across the breadth of the portfolio and ultimately, again it's putting ourselves in position to serve consumers in a way that gets them the product that they need when they want it and where they want it. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then Omar I will take your question on sneakers. We still see tremendous opportunity with respect to sneakers. I will give you some dimension on where we see that opportunity. In terms of what you referred to as kind of special nature of the product that were launching on sneakers. We still supply a very small percent of the demand that were seeing on sneakers. In fact just this morning, we launched a few pretty unique collaboration and again saw sell out within minutes. That’s fantastic in terms of the heat that some of our styles create, but also an opportunity. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">Couples of other opportunities within sneakers are apparel. What we done with apparel and in limited cases where we've launched apparel either collaboration or apparel innovation we see an incredible demand and we really have. It's almost overstating it to say we scratched the surface in terms of the heat we can create and connectivity to consumers around apparel. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">Women's is another great opportunity through the sneakers app and then two last dimensions I speak to product creation, that's done with the membership data that we get through the sneakers app in mind. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">We launched the shoe in this past year. Based on data and analytics relatively Dominican community in New York, which was incredibly well received based on demand and branch. Around that we also see the opportunity, as Mark touched on, to launch innovation directly to members. Sneaker is for people who love the innovation that we provide in the app. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then finally, what both of us touched on is we often focus on the businesses that we have here in North America because we all experience them as consumers here in North America but we got a tremendous potential to continue to expand the sneakers app globally geographically in markets around the world. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I have to add that the core answer to your question about sustaining the heat in sneakers is going to be the product itself. So the strength of the product, how we refresh it, making sure supply demand is in the right ratio and now the whole experience on sneakers is going to continually evolve I think to make it a very compelling kind of have to check back in day to day comp experience.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you, Omar. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Omar Saad</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Understood. Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Operator we will take our next question please. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks. Hope you're all doing well. I’m interested in the comments on digital and physical intersection and how successful that's been recruiting new customers to the digital ecosystem. Does that make you rethink the role of physical retail in the go to market strategies? And then maybe this will dovetail with my second question. With respect to the key city strategies, are there cities you would highlight as being further along in demonstration of the efficacy of that strategy? </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Well, we see the first of all, the intersection of physical and digital is going to continue to be more and more intimate relationship. I think we're looking at a lot of experimentation, trial and error learning from some of the tests that we're doing. Ultimately, it's about making the experience physically or digitally more richer, more dimensionalized experience for consumers. We are saying where we have those digital connections through like NIKE app at retail, we're seeing the engagement from consumers rise significantly. And the actual spend per consumer in those cases actually jumps up dramatically. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">So this is something that we don't think it's just a -- it's not just a current trend, this is the future of the fusion of digital and physical is going to continue. And this is a huge priority. It's a source of investment for us. It's ultimately around how do we better serve customers members. And you'll continue to see us evolve that dramatically. And our ambition is to lead in that space. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then to your question, on key cities, we're seeing over indexing growth in our key cities as compared to the countries in which they are. We're also seeing over indexing results from a brand perspective. Our brand is the number one brand in each of those key cities. I would tell you that in terms of prioritization, which I think was the spirit of your question, our priorities have been in bringing our Consumer Direct Offense to life, first in London, New York, and Shanghai. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">So that's where you see us having invested in the new houses of innovation in New York and Shanghai, which do -- that is a bit of a segue from what Mark was just speaking to merging physical and digital in an experience that the consumer really hasn't had for NIKE or anyone else in the marketplace. Those experiences have well exceeded our expectations. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">LA is another market where we've started to bring this to life with our smaller format, concept NIKE Live. So I would say that to answer your question, in short, London, New York and Shanghai, I think, are the cities where we're furthest along. But we've got really energized teams in each of the key cities. In fact, we just had all of our key city teams not just jammed together here a couple of weeks ago, at our headquarters to share best practices and learnings and align on how to leverage what we can create globally or in one key city and another key city. So we really think feel great about the progress we're making against that offense. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Nitesh Sharan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks, Jim. Operator, we will take our last question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your last question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Your line is open. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Poser </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you for taking my question. I was really wondering, about how you view your brands. As a follow-up on how you view your brand's perceived in China. Somebody said that you were perceived -- other brands were perceived as American or U.S. brands or German brands. But NIKE is perceived as NIKE. Love to get your comment on that. And I have one other question.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure, Sam, thanks for the question. I'll start. Yes, as both Mark and I said, our approach has been to be of China for China. And that's not a new approach. That approach is not based on dynamics of late. That's been the approach we've had in for China for two, three decades. And it ranges from the strong leadership team we have in place there with local talent that understands the consumer. Obviously, in our history, it dates back to our sourcing of product in China. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">Over the years, it's been about us fueling the passion for sport and participation in sport, not simply being a commercial enterprise in China, but having a bigger view in terms of the purpose and the impact that we could create, in terms of the lively consumers in China. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">And then that last point extends to our relationship with the Ministry of Sport and Education. Our partnerships there as well as our partnerships, more probably out in front in terms of the global impact of the teams, athletes and Federation's in China, but why we're invested in sponsoring those teams and athletes and federations is because of their impact on local consumers in China.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Poser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. And then secondly -- </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And also as the insights that we're getting for China are actually helping us create China -- products that's more relevant for China but also other parts of the world. So this isn't about importing Western concepts into China as much as it is trying to actually take the insights we gain in China and use it to enrich our global position as a brand and as a product offering. So it's truly not just local for local. It's China putting us in a position to be a better global company. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Poser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. And then just to follow-up on a prior question. The RFID, does this mean with your core partners, Nordstrom and Foot Locker and so on Dick's and so on, that you will be able to overtime, interact with them and maybe interact between your systems to be able to make your inventory act as a whole more efficiently?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. Sorry. Sam, did you add more to that question. Go ahead. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Poser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Well, yes, and I'd love color and may add something else. But go from there.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mark Parker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. RFID provides us an opportunity to do what we aspire to do, which is connect the marketplace and do that through our NIKE Direct business, but also through strategic wholesale partners, partners that we view as being part of the NIKE Network of the future. We are already testing the use of RFID in being able to give consumers greater visibility into product down to the style, color and size that they're looking for. </p>, <p class=""p p15"">And I'd say that's probably the sharpest and most intuitive aspect of this opportunity is visibility into the inventory for a company like NIKE with the breadth and depth of our portfolio is somewhat limited across our broad distribution within the marketplace, being able to leverage our RFID to give almost 100% visibility into what we have, by style, color and size across our marketplace is an incredible opportunity in terms of meeting consumer demand real time in the moment. </p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Sam Poser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">And then lastly, for your speed initiative -- with your speed initiative, how long do you get to double the speed or beyond that this RFID will certainly help that?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andy Campion</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yes. Well, that's one of the measures of success. We feel really good about the progress we're making. On doubling the percentage of products and what we call one half the time to market. We've seen some really strong results over the past year. And we expect that to continue through the next year. And a lot of that effort is led by what we call the Express Lane. And Express Lane as I mentioned, I think, I commented that 20% of our product, sale revenue in EMEA is actually coming from our Express Lane initiative. </p>, <p class=""p p15"">So we see the speed initiative for NIKE, the time to market cut in half initiative, really accelerating through this next fiscal year. And it's ultimately going to be a big competitive advantage for us.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Mark Parker</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you, Sam. And thank you, everybody. Thanks. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Bye.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.</p>]"

Today's call is being recorded.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Chuck Triano</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2019 performance and our updated 2019 financial guidance. We appreciate your flexibility today. I know it's been a busy morning for everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I'm joined today by our CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at pfizer.com/investors. You'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Also any discussion related to our recently announced proposed transaction with Mylan to combine Upjohn and Mylan to create a new global pharmaceutical company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that are discussed under the forward-looking statements section in the press release we issued this morning. Today's call is not intended and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Albert Bourla</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the progress we are making in the business, the latest advancements within our R&amp;D pipeline, and our ongoing work to advocate for policies that support affordable access for patients.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">But before I address these topics, I would like to make a few comments regarding our recent activities to reshape our company including the agreement we announced this morning.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We have been very busy. We recently completed the Therachon acquisition. We expect to close the Array acquisition very soon. We are about to create the joint venture with GSK for our consumer business and we just announced the proposed agreement with Mylan for our Upjohn business.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">When all these actions are complete, Pfizer will be a smaller, more focused, science-based company with a singular focus on innovative pharma. We believe we will be in a position where our pipeline will be able to move the needle even more dramatically in terms of our long-term growth prospects.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">In fact, we see our growth profile improving in three ways. We expect our five-year revenue CAGR to be higher than it otherwise would have been. We see the growth starting earlier because the Lyrica LOE cliff will go away. And given our smaller size, we believe the growth will be more sustainable.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We also will still have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in growth while returning capital to our investors. These are deliberate steps we are taking to make Pfizer a very different company and one that is even better equipped to fulfill our purpose; breakthroughs that change patients' lives.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now, let me talk about the quarter. I am pleased to report that our performance for both the quarter and the first half of the year has been solid. In the second quarter, revenues were up 2% operationally company-wide. Our growth was driven again by volume increases, partially offset by price declines.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">If we look at our Biopharmaceuticals Group which represented 72% of our revenue base this quarter, the volume increases had an even bigger impact on the growth despite a net pricing decline in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Overall, we saw volume growth in several key brands emerging markets and biosimilars. These growth drivers were partially offset primarily by the continued impact of the loss of exclusivity of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017, a 20% operational decline in Upjohn's revenues in China, declines in Enbrel internationally, and Lyrica in the U.S. and EU, and also product supply shortages and LOEs in the hospital business.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Let's begin with the results from the Biopharmaceuticals Group. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business which grew its top line 6% operationally in the quarter. Our Oncology business was particularly strong, up 23% operationally driven by Ibrance, Xtandi, Inlyta, and RETACRIT.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Global revenues for Ibrance were up 27% operationally in the quarter to $1.3 billion. While most of Ibrance growth continues to come from international markets, we did see 12% growth in the U.S. during the second quarter. We believe this accelerated growth rate is the result of our effort to target specific physicians who had not been prescribing CDK inhibitors or had prescribed them to only a small set of patients. Overall, the CDK class appears to have gained additional ground in the U.S. which is good news for patients.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">For Xtandi alliance revenues in the U.S. grew 18% operationally to $201 million. Xtandi is the leading branded novel for monotherapy to treat castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We continue to see increased Xtandi prescriptions for new patients.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Inlyta revenues increased 34% operationally to $104 million. This included 82% growth in the U.S. Inlyta has benefited from recent FDA approvals for the combination of Inlyta plus Bavencio and Inlyta plus pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Finally, RETACRIT, our biosimilar for Epogen and Procrit, is off to a good start in the U.S. with $30 million of revenues in its second full quarter following launch.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Beyond Oncology, we had several other strong product performances. Xeljanz continued to perform well. Global revenues were up 36% operationally to $613 million. We saw continued volume growth in the rheumatoid arthritis indication. And the recent launches of ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis also contributed to the growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Regarding the update to Xeljanz prescribing information in the U.S., we remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which has been studied in more than 20 clinical trials and prescribed to more than 208,000 adult patients worldwide. At this stage, we do expect some impact to prescribing. But based on our initial commercial assessment, we believe that on an enterprise level the 2019 impact will be offset by strengths in other parts of the business. Xeljanz remains an important treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis in appropriate patients who are suffering from these debilitating autoimmune conditions.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Eliquis continues to perform well. Global revenues were up 26% operationally to $1.1 billion. Eliquis is now the number one oral anticoagulant in 10 countries including the U.S. and the U.K. Our recent launch of Tafamidis with the brand name of Vyndaqel has been in line with our expectations. As the first and only FDA-approved treatment for patients suffering from ATTR-Cardiomyopathy, Vyndaqel meets a previously unmet need. We have in place programs to help support affordable access for patients and we are working to facilitate early detection and diagnosis through the use of scintigraphy and by developing innovative AI solutions. AI I mean artificial intelligence solutions.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In fact, we have already seen a significant increase in diagnosis rates and since the launch have added approximately 500 commercial patients to the approximately 900 clinical trial and compassionate use patients that were already on the drug for ATTR-Cardiomyopathy in the U.S. We expect these numbers to grow as awareness and diagnosis rates increase.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Prevnar 13 pediatric revenues were negatively impacted by some government purchasing patterns in the year-ago quarter as well as during the first quarter of this year. However, year-to-date, it is performing in line. It is important to note that even with the recent change in its recommendation ACIP maintains a recommendation for the vaccine for adults 65 and older.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">However, now it is under a new classification called shared clinical decision-making, wherein the decision to vaccinate should be made at the individual level between health care providers and their patients. The vaccine also maintains its reimbursement status with payers.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">While the updated recommendation is not effective until the publication of the morbidity and mortality weekly report, we will assess any impact based on the customer feedback after the language is posted. At this stage, we anticipate some reduction in demand, but we believe that on an enterprise level the 2019 impact will be offset by strengths in other parts of the business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In sterile injectables, manufacturing supply constraints continue to impact our top line in the U.S. We continue to make steady progress toward remediation and to expect these issues to be significantly improved by the end of 2019. Once we are back on track, we continue to expect this business to be a solid growth contributor in the future.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now let me speak about Upjohn. Revenues for our Upjohn business were down 7% operationally. The main driver was China where we saw a 20% operational decline driven primarily by volume-based procurement reforms that were implemented in March 2019. These reforms unfavorably impacted Lipitor and Norvasc. This impact has been anticipated since the beginning of the year and was already included in our 2019 financial guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Given first half 2019 operational growth of 13% and the outlook for the remainder of the year, revenues for Upjohn in China for the full year are expected to grow by low to mid-single digits operationally. In cities where our products did not win the tender in the second quarter, we expect continued volume growth although off a lower base.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In addition, we continue to see growth opportunities in non-tender products. We also saw a 9% decline in the U.S. The primary drivers were continued generic competition for Viagra and wholesaler destocking for Lyrica in anticipation of multi-source generic competition as well as continued industry-wide pricing challenges.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For our Consumer Healthcare, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare revenues were up 1% operationally in the quarter. This reflected 4% operational growth in international markets, partially offset by a 2% decline in the U.S. We anticipate the formation of our joint venture with GSK to occur by August 1 and we expect the newly created business to unlock meaningful value for Pfizer, our customers and our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning to R&amp;D. We continue to be excited with the progress we are making with our pipeline both in terms of the breadth of opportunities and the depth of our science. Since our last earnings call on April 30, we have received seven approvals for new medicines or indications.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the U.S., the FDA has approved Vyndaqel and Vyndamax for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy; ZIRABEV a biosimilar to Avastin for the treatment of five different types of cancer; a new indication for Inflectra, a biosimilar for Remicade, which is now approved for pediatric patients six years of age and older, with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis; Ruxience, a biosimilar to Rituxan, for the treatment of certain cancers and autoimmune conditions; and BAVENCIO in combination with Inlyta, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In Europe, the European Commission has approved TALZENNA for patients with inherited BRCA-mutated locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and Lorviqua for treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We are working hard to ensure patients have access to these important medicines as soon as we can.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In addition to the approvals, we continue to make progress with other candidates in our pipeline. In vaccines, we expect a proof-of-concept data readout in the coming months from the infant Phase 2 study of our next-gen 20-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate. Our multivalent Group B streptococcus vaccine candidate started Phase 2 trials in pregnant women, with a study being conducted in South Africa, a region with one of the highest burdens of this potentially devastating infection.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In rare disease, we presented initial Phase 1b clinical data on our investigational gene therapy to potentially treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Data from the Phase 1b study are providing the basis for an informed decision on dose selection and the design of a currently planned Phase 3 pivotal study that could begin in the first half of 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With our partner Sangamo Therapeutics, we announced updated results from the Phase 1/2I Alta Study, evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. The FDA recently granted a regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation for this potential therapy. The tissue factor pathway inhibitor, TFPI monoclonal antibody for subcutaneous weekly treatment of hemophilia A and B met the preset criteria for proof-of-concept. It is advancing to our pivotal studies. We expect pivotal readout during the third quarter for Rivipansel in sickle cell.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Inflammation &amp; Immunology, we set positive top line results from a Phase 3 pivotal study of our JAK1 inhibitor Abrocitinib in patients aged 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Additional data from another study in the JADE program will be available later this year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In internal medicine, based on our assessment of the tanezumab subcutaneous data and the initial discussion with the FDA, we will prioritize tanezumab 2.5 milligram for moderate to severe osteoarthritis. We are targeting a U.S. regulatory submission in late Q4 2019, or early 2020 to be followed by EU and Japan. At this time, regulatory submissions are not planned for the 5-milligram dose for osteoarthritis or in chronic lower back pain, but we are continuing to assess and will maintain an open dialogue with the regulatory authorities on future potential pathways for tanezumab.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Lastly, in Oncology, we are excited about the pending acquisition of Array BioPharma. We believe Array's assets fit neatly into our business and we expect the three key drivers of the acquisition, the colorectal cancer opportunity, the existing royalty stream and Array's research platform to become solid contributors to Pfizer's growth potential as we move into the next decade. We expect the deal to close in the near term.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As we have said in the past, none of our breakthroughs will do patients any good if patients can't afford them. Pfizer remains committed to working with policymakers at both the Federal and State levels and on both sides of the aisle, on common sense solutions to improve patients' affordability.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We continue to work on the policy solutions I laid out in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in February. These include capping seniors' out-of-pocket costs in Part D, incentivizing value-based arrangements and establishing a robust biosimilars market to lower healthcare costs.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In summary, we delivered a solid second quarter and first half of the year. Our pipeline is producing new medicines. Our commercial strategy is helping us reach millions of patients around the world. And most important, we continue to see volume gains as opposed to pricing gains, driving our business.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking ahead, we expect the pending combination of Upjohn and Mylan to allow both Pfizer and Upjohn to have a singular focus on their respective parts of the business. We believe this will enable us to deliver enhanced value for patients, colleagues and shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I also want to congratulate Michael Goettler on being named CEO of the combined company. While I personally would be sorry to see him leave Pfizer, I know from having worked closely with him for many years that the new company is getting a strong leader and the right person to help it seize the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Frank D'Amelio</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. The charts I'm reviewing today are available on our website. Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter 2019 revenues were approximately $13.3 billion, which reflects operational revenue growth of $324 million or 2% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $527 million or 4%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business recorded 6% operational revenue growth in the second quarter 2019, driven primarily by Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz globally and by 12% operational growth in emerging markets, led by 26% operational growth in China; partially offset primarily by Enbrel internationally, primarily due to biosimilar competition in developed Europe, and the unfavorable impact of timing of purchases made by governments in certain emerging markets, and Prevnar 13 in the U.S., primarily reflecting lower government purchases for pediatric indication and continued revenue decline for the adult indication due to a declining catch-up opportunity, compared to the prior year quarter; and the hospital business in developed markets, primarily due to expected negative impact of generic competition and product supply shortages.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Revenues for our Upjohn business in the second quarter decreased 7% operationally...</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulty. Please remain on the line, and your call will resume momentarily.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Chuck Triano</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay, folks, I think we're back. We had some technical difficulties. Apologize for that. I think at this point, we'll have Frank pick up just before where he left-off.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Frank D'Amelio</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Yeah. And so, I'll start -- I'll try to connect the dots. So, as Albert stated earlier, revenues for Upjohn in China increased 13% operationally in the first half of 2019, and are expected to grow by low to mid-single digits operationally for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And the 9% decline for Upjohn in the U.S. primarily driven by lower revenues for Viagra resulting from increased generic competition and Lyrica reflecting volume declines due to wholesaler destocking in advance of anticipated multi-source generic competition, that was expected to begin on July 1, but instead began on July 19.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Revenues of our Consumer Healthcare business increased 1% operationally, reflecting 4% operational growth in international markets, primarily offset by a 2% decline in the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In the second quarter, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.89, a $0.24 increase compared to the year-ago quarter, which was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower income tax due to an IRS audit settlement, higher revenues on an operational basis, lower acquisition-related costs and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by lower net gains in equity securities and foreign exchange.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Adjusted diluted EPS for the second quarter was $0.80 versus $0.77 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues on an operational basis, lower cost of sales and lower weighted average shares outstanding, partially and primarily offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange as well as lower other income.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Finally, diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by approximately $280 million shares to $5.67 billion versus the year-ago quarter, primarily due to Pfizer's ongoing share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018 and in the first quarter 2019, which was partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As I previously mentioned, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter, revenues by approximately $527 million and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses and adjusted R&amp;D expenses in the aggregate by $310 million. Consequently, foreign exchange had a $0.03 per share negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Moving on to 2019 financial guidance. We updated certain components of our 2019 financial guidance primarily to reflect the anticipated August 1, 2019 formation of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the pending Array acquisition. As a result, our guidance now reflects revenues and expenses associated with the Consumer Healthcare business through July 31, 2019 but now excludes revenues and expenses from Consumer Healthcare from August 1st, through the end of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Guidance now includes Pfizer's pro-rata share of the consumer JV's anticipated earnings, which will be recorded on a quarterly basis in other income/deducts with a one-quarter lag. As a result, guidance for adjusted other income/deducts and adjusted diluted EPS reflects Pfizer's share of only two months of earnings from the JV for the third quarter which will be recorded by Pfizer in the fourth quarter 2019. Therefore, on a net basis for the remainder of the year, the consumer JV is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS, representing the foregone PCS earnings, contribution from August through the end of the year, partially offset by the two months of equity income from the JV.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our guidance update also incorporates the expected impact from the anticipated near-term completion of the Array acquisition, and to a much lesser extent the Therachon acquisition which closed earlier this month. These transactions are expected to modestly increase our adjusted R&amp;D expense, and increase our net interest expense within our other adjusted income/deducts line resulting in an anticipated $0.04 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Importantly, our guidance update absorbs the anticipated net impact of various other drivers, some of which are expected to have a favorable impact on our financial results offset by other drivers that negatively impact our outlook for 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">On the favorable side, we now expect greater contributions in 2019 from certain biopharma products, primarily within our Oncology and internal medicine businesses than we previously anticipated, and our Upjohn business benefited from the delayed entry of generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. which is expected to begin on July 1 but did not start until July 19. However, we expect this operational upside to our forecast to be offset by foreign exchange, and other recent product developments for Prevnar and Xeljanz.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">On foreign exchange, we had originally anticipated in January that FX would have an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately $900 million and $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS compared to foreign exchange rates from 2018. We now anticipate that foreign exchange will have a $1.2 billion unfavorable impact on revenue and $0.08 on adjusted diluted EPS for the year based on actual exchange rates in the first half of the year and mid-July FX rates for the remainder of 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So foreign exchange is expected to have an incremental negative impact of approximately $350 million on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS compared to our January guidance. On an operational basis the ACIP's provisional recommendation to the pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for Prevnar 13 in adults in the U.S. as well as the recent revision of the Xeljanz U.S. prescribing information have negatively impacted our outlook for both products for the remainder of 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In summary, our guidance update slowly reflects pending business development activity and absorbs the various operational puts and takes that we have seen so far this year as well as the incremental negative impact of foreign exchange. Finally, as a reminder, our financial guidance for adjusted diluted EPS reflects share repurchases totaling $8.9 billion completed in the first quarter, which we expect will be offset by about half from dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, we delivered solid financial results with 2% operational revenue growth, 4% adjusted diluted EPS growth and 6% operational revenue growth in our Biopharmaceuticals Group compared with the year-ago quarter. This keeps us on track to deliver solid financial performance in 2019. We updated our 2019 financial guidance based on the anticipated near-term completions of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK and the Array BioPharma acquisition and the completed Therachon acquisition. We accomplished multiple product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update and we returned $12.9 billion to shareholders during the first half of 2019 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2019 and beyond.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Chuck Triano</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Good. Thank you, Frank and Albert. And sorry about the technical glitch. Evidently, we didn't have unlimited talk time on our calling plan, I would guess. But with that, let's turn it to start the Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p7"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-And-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Scala</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. I have two. It looks like 2020 pro forma EPS for Pfizer alone could be about $2.10. Is that a reasonable estimate at this juncture? So that's the first question. Second Albert, you had been steadfast that a major transaction was unlikely while Pfizer was in the midst of several important launches. I'm just wondering, what changed and what does this tell us about the outlook for the new products – thank you – meaning the Upjohn transaction? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">All right. Let me cover this one, and then I will ask Frank to comment on the EPS. And frankly, nothing has – we always said that the internal separation of Upjohn was a significant theme in the value creation thesis when we announced it's great. I mean, Upjohn has a significant business model. They remain in Pfizer. And the substantial autonomy was essential for its success. That was always the thesis. And we said that, we will not explore options before we spend after this business, because we want to focus right now on spending up this business. But I have to tell you that we substantially completed the internal Upjohn organization separation earlier this month. That involves multiple things including legal entities. We have a new organization but it is already operational worldwide. It is fully staffed. The Shanghai headquarters is already up and running. And the business it performed according to our expectations actually a little bit better.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So we always look of course to maximize value of the business. When we assessed the potential of combining these two companies, we quickly saw the potential to create value for shareholders in excess of what could be created if the businesses will remain as such. Now, that doesn't create any disruption to our main biopharmaceutical business because it's already separate business, but continues to operate as separate business as it does. It's going to have a little bit of disruption in Upjohn as we integrate, but all of that we took into consideration when we saw how much bigger value we can create for our shareholders by combining those two businesses. Frank, on the EPS?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So Steve, what we did is we gave some -- I'll call it preliminary financial numbers for 2020. We covered revenue. We covered EBT as a percentage of revenue operating cash flow and we obviously made some comments about -- I made some comments about the dividend. We did that obviously to be helpful. In terms of specific EPS numbers, we'll do what we typically do which is we'll provide EPS guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter earnings call as we've done in prior years.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Frank. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Tim Anderson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. If I could just go back to split. So splitting up first contemplated in early 2011, then in 2017 you guys kind of called it off. And one of the reasons for that was the valuation and spec pharma went down. That was kind of viewed as the comp for established products. And I think on a sum of the parts basis you guys are worried you wouldn't unlock value.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So if I fast-forward to where we are today spec pharma multiples have gone even lower. That's going to be some variation if that's going to be what's applied to the Upjohn business. So that part of the problem hasn't really gotten any better. And I'm wondering kind of what changed in your viewpoint from <strong>--</strong> impediment to today where apparently it's not. So that's the first question.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Second question is just the emerging markets part of Upjohn I think is about $4 billion or 40% of total Upjohn revenues. Does this disrupt the corporate footprint in emerging markets that was a pretty sizable business that's a scale business as well? And was there any contemplation on keeping the emerging market part within the parent Pfizer company?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. Thank you, Tim. Look as you said the scenario split in the company was put to bed earlier on. And that scenario was mainly a scenario to take advantage of the multiples at the time so it was kind of a financial engineering. But it didn't work and will not work in Pfizer. This is why we moved away from this strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">What we tried to do is to create operational value, value that is creating by putting similar things together. And the first step we did was to create Upjohn because Upjohn had very different characteristics from the previous established products. It was basically carefully selected assets that was trying to get advantage of the very positive demographics that were happening in Asia and particularly in China in terms of the types of volume creation. And that was something that we completed internally and we always knew that autonomous operation having them run almost like a company within a company was going to create value. So that's the first step</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But when we assessed the complementarity of the Upjohn business together with Mylan we understood that then we can create a substantially better bigger company. So this is the reason why we said that Upjohn instead of keeping it inside which is very different than the established products it in all aspects very different portfolio very different size, very different everything is now going to create significant value by putting together with Mylan.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now as regards the emerging markets not at all. Let's start with China and then I will take it to the emerging markets in general. Upjohn -- let's start with Upjohn. As part of the new company now we have a strong pipeline we didn't have before and they'll have a strong pipeline to put through the great commercial infrastructure in China to fuel the growth.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now let’s see China? The remaining -- the Biopharmaceutical Pfizer's presence in China. The remaining Pfizer it is almost half of the $5 billion that we have right now in China. So the size will be significant. And then you can see the growth prospects of this business is growing 26% in the second quarter. So it's doing very well. But we are even more excited about the futures growth of this business. We maintain all our R&amp;D and free force capabilities in China, by the way all of that are completely segregated right now. And in addition -- with Upjohn I mean -- and in addition we are expecting to file up to 19 new products in the next few years in China. So that's very significant.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now let's move to in general the emerging markets in the remaining. The size of emerging markets currently in the Biopharmaceutical businesses is almost 20% of the total business. And if you see the growth trajectory of this business is growing almost triple the rate than the remaining of the Biopharmaceutical business. So with this transaction we do not reduce the scale or the growth prospects at all of the main Pfizer into emerging markets.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Thank you, Albert of that. Move to our next question please, operator.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Terence Flynn</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for the Biopharma business you guided to five year growth rate at the high end of mid-single digits. So just wondering any meaningful differences there in your projections versus consensus? And then Albert would welcome any additional perspective on the proposed Senate drug pricing legislation and maybe your Part D exposure on a pro forma basis? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. Thank you very much and very good questions. First of all, on the first we never comment on other people's projections. I know that this is your job to do projections, but we have our internal. So Frank, you want to make a comment </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">…on that and then I will take the second question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure. So I can comment on the revenue and obviously to Albert's point we'll talk about our numbers -- I'll talk about our numbers. So from my perspective the 5-year CAGR -- revenue growth CAGR will improve. We've said previously mid-single digits. Now we're saying high mid-single digits. We'll see the growth faster. The reason we'll see the growth faster is immediately upon close Lyrica LOE goes to Upjohn so we won't have that. We believe the growth will be more sustainable because it's on a smaller base. And then most importantly, we will leverage that growth to the bottom-line as we always do. So that's how we think about the revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. So let me make some comments about the Senate. As you know, last week there was a markup in the Senate Finance Committee. We cannot support this bill as written and it's not only us but in general the pharma has expressed their frustration. Obviously, there are some provisions of the proposed bill that we do support and we believe will help lower spending on prescription drugs. And -- such as instituting out-of-pocket caps for patients or improving incentives for biosimilars utilization. These are very positive things in the bill.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">However, we believe that none of these in -- for none of these the bill goes far enough. We would expect that they would do much more to incentivize biosimilars and we would expect that they could do much more to create relief on patients.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Also the bill while it generates savings for the health care system, it does it with punitive measures for the industry and does not distribute the savings to patients. And thus does very little to fix the issue as a result of high out-of-pocket costs for them. This is the fundamental issue right now in the political life and this is the fundamental issue of the pharmaceuticals business. More there -- on that needs to be addressed.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now we are working very productively with the administration and we are working very productively with senators and we plan to do it with also -- to continue to make it with Senator Grassley and Wyland and Senate members from both sides of the aisle to see how we can improve this proposal. And also we noted that in the Senate bill there was the unanimous support -- almost unanimous support to introduce a comprehensive rebate reform into this bill. This is very, very positive and I believe that will be one of the very meaningful tools that the Senate Committee has in their hands to reduce out-of-pocket costs.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Now as regards what will be the size of the impact it's very early to calculate because our experience is that typically these things are changing dramatically between markup and then what comes to the floor and then eventually what is becoming a bill. So I would rather stay on the basic principles that the bill is punitive for the pharma, but more importantly doesn't distribute all of the savings that is created for the patients.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Right. Thanks for the perspective, Albert. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Umer Raffat</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch upon a couple of things, if I may. First, as we think about the China pricing concerns, the question that I've been toying with is Lipitor and Norvasc were down 27% or so this quarter. We've seen some evidence online that the tenders in China could be as high as 70% price drop. So, is the price drop done on Lipitor and Norvasc or are we expecting more? And then, the same theme over to the antibiotics business as well, because presumably the 7 plus 4 initiative could expand to antibiotics, and your thoughts on China business as it relates to antibiotics? Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. And I think Michael gave a very good overview of the situation in China in a previous call, but I can give you also a summary. I think the -- right now, the value -- the volume-based procurement will expand from 11 cities to more cities, and that will affect the price. So, I think that the prices will go down.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">At the same time, we see that there is tremendous volume opportunity of going up. So, as a result, we think that eventually the business will be the base as these close to 31 cities, but there will be continued growth for the high-quality branded products, because the Chinese healthcare system, including physicians and patients, they place a lot of value in the brand equity of this drug.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, that has been calculated in all our numbers, but were included for China, and you saw it in the previous presentation. And that will continue. By the way, our antibiotics, they are in Pfizer -- in the remaining Pfizer, they're not part of our Upjohn it's part of Sterling injectables, and they're not at QC, so they are not affected at all by that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So far, as regard the trajectory for our business in China. From the rebates business, we think because of the volumes, after all this price hit the significant volume expansion, we will continue seeing volume growth -- revenues growth in China.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you, Albert. Next question please, operator.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">The next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Chris Schott</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thanks very much. Just on the margin side of the story. As we think about high to mid-single-digit growth for the Pfizer Biopharma business, can you just elaborate on what that looks like in terms of the magnitude of margin expansion and pre-tax growth we can think about for Pfizer over time? I guess trying to get to the question here, is there areas you still need to ramp investment on that core innovative business? Or can we think about much of the top line growth over the next few years, falling largely to the bottom line?</p>, <p class=""p p10"">My second question, which is coming back to Tafamidis, and just the launch dynamics on that product. Just any early color of how we should -- how you're thinking about the coming quarters, and the type of ramp that we should be thinking about as that product gets off the ground? Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Frank, would you like to comment how we see margins evolving in joint company?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure. So Chris, I talked about in my prepared remarks, margins -- IBT margins, I talked about in the mid-30s. The reason I did that was because we're shifting income from above the line to below the line with things like the consumer joint venture, think about above other income to in other income. So, we used IBT, as I'll call it, the benchmark to use going forward as a percentage of revenues, so mid-30s.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But, we fully expect as our revenues grow for us to leverage that to the bottom line. I think we've demonstrated that over the years, we will continue to do that going forward. So, yes, as our revenues grow, we expect margin expansion to the bottom line then obviously to not only to IBT but obviously to the EPS line as well.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. Chris, I can just -- just to clarify. IBT as income before tax, I'm not sure how common that phrase is used. But for us, as operating income, plus other income and that's the IBT, that Frank's been referencing.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Chuck.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you, Frank. Angela, why don't you give some color on Tafamidis please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Great, thanks. And thanks for the question, Chris. So let me share with you what we're seeing, on our side in terms of the performance of Tafamidis. We are releasing some nice positive leading indicators, for this launch. And let me walk you through sort of the funnel of patients. And how we're seeing things play out.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">First of all, we have approximately 3,000 ATTR-CM patients that we've already diagnosed. And these are patients outside of the 900 that you heard Albert talk about in his opening comments, that were part of an early access program as well as clinical trial supply.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So of these 3,000, about 1,400 of them have been prescribed Vyndaqel. And of those 1,400, 500 have actually received the medicine. And so, what we have here now are about 900 patients that are in process of clearing the access and reimbursement sort of logistics via prior authorizations that will then ultimately enable them to get the prescription.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And so I also would maybe like to mention that, so far, we're seeing the prior authorization process improve pretty much on a daily basis. And only 16 patients, 1-6, have received some sort of rejection. And even those rejections could simply be just due to documentation purposes.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So hopefully that lays out for you, where the patient flow is coming from. And how we're seeing patients get onto the drug. But also say that, we're very pleased with what we've seen so far. And what we're seeing both in terms of diagnosis as well as the process for patients to actually get their drug.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Great, thank you, Angela. Next question please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Andrew Baum</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. A couple of questions please. First, we are living in a very active M&amp;A environment thinking of AbbVie, Bristol, Takeda and so on and so forth. Your new structure will leave you a smaller company, but you will have the $12 billion additional cash from the Mylan transaction.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">How are you thinking about deploying your balance sheet? And whether there is a need to reconfigure the recent historic stance of shying away from larger-scale, M&amp;A? So that's the first question.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then the second, more of a housekeeping question. Inlyta is an increasingly important drug as you called out in relation to the renal cell approvals. Do you have a crystal line patent which would take you out until 2030?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">You list the basic patents in your annual report which is 25. What is your confidence that, in the fact you may be able to derive cash flows in the U.S. all the way out to 2030 using that second patent? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you very much, Andrew. Let me make a comment on BT, and then, I will ask Frank to comment on the capital structure of the new company. And then Angela you will answer the Inlyta.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, as I said before, nothing is changing with this deal, in the way that we see business development for Pfizer going forward. You will see Pfizer to be active in BD continues to be active in BD.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And as we have said, preferably that will be on bolt-on opportunities, that would be on early to mid-stage opportunities, where maybe there is higher risk as you know, but the value creation is further greater. And the risk of operational disruption is perhaps lower.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So, we have this philosophy before and continue having it. Regarding large-scale M&amp;A, as we said, we'll never say never and -- but right now the opportunity we have to advance our pipeline is unique. And I still do not see the need to do a large deal right now, because that can only create disruptions.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">With that, I would like to ask Frank to give a more general overview on the capital structure.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Frank D'Amelio</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure. So, Andrew, you mentioned the $12 billion of cash that we're going to receive from the transaction. Our intention is to pay down debt with that $12 billion of cash. That solidifies what's already a really strong balance sheet.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We continue to have -- we expect to continue to have a solid credit rating. And then as you mentioned, we'll also generate $11 billion to $12 billion in operating cash flow post-close.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Obviously, from that we will pay the dividend. And we said we will keep our shareholders whole on the dividend. We get the importance of the dividend. Obviously, CapEx investing in the business and then the remainder will be looking at relative to share repurchases and to business development.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Angela, do you want to comment on the patent?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Sure, just quickly. Our main composition of matter patent takes us up to 2025. But of course, because of the value of the product we will continue to pursue other patents. And so, we'll see and to be determined where that takes us.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Thank you. Next question please?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Gerberry</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just coming back to the top line growth target of high mid-single-digits, could you just walk us through your assumptions?</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Does that include the success -- clinical success for Ibrance adjuvant as well as status quo in the pneumococcal vaccine space? And then your comment on, Vyndaqel the 3,000 patients, so I think that's about 1,400 additional patients versus what were out there maybe diagnosed and on dexlinosol.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Is that I mean sort of you're already seeing the impact of cardiologist testing and diagnosing TTR cardiomyopathy? Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that increase in the diagnosed and treated patient pool?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you, Jason. Let me first clear the question about what's included in our projections of high end of mid-single-digit growth. And the way we always do it, it is with risk adjustment. There is nothing that is fully baked in.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We have a very big pipeline. And we have particularly a very big Phase III portfolio. And all of them they are appropriately risk-adjusted, so there's nothing that it is assumed a success over there or failure per se.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The fact that, we have the risks spread in many, many assets. Because, as you know we have submitted everything in time, this is what gives us a lot of confidence, that the risk adjustments are accurate.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">With that I will ask Angela to comment.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">On the diagnosis, so what we're seeing from a diagnosis perspective and what's helping us are the following: I think first of all, we're seeing some good use of PYP scintigraphy, which is the non-invasive method for identifying and diagnosing ATTR-CM and a good -- a high utilization of that as a non-invasive mechanism.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But also in terms of where the diagnoses coming from, we're seeing a good spread between the centers of excellence, between specialty cardiology, as well as general cardiology. So I think that the education efforts that we have ongoing about the signs and symptoms of ATTR-CM has as creates suspicion around them. It's happening across all different aspects of cardiology, whether it's in academic centers or in the community. And I think that this is why I was saying that we have some really positive leading indicators of this launch and it's going according to plan.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. Thank you very much, Angela. Next question please operator.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">The next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Louise Chen</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is as you trim down to these core assets that higher end of the mid single-digit range, is that organic growth or does that include M&amp;A? And then I wanted to ask you also on Array. The Anchor CRC and the Adjuvant setting how do you think about those opportunities in light of the BEACON data that you've seen so far?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then my last question is on your DMD product. Do some of the safety issues that came up in your Phase 1 study change your view about the market opportunity? What doses of the hospitalizations occur and was it due to promoter or AAV9? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you very, very much Louise. Let me first take out of the way the first one which is an easy. We do not include any M&amp;A in our projections. When we speak about high end of mid single-digit growth, we mean organically. Now Mikael, can you please comment on Array and DMD?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mikael Dolsten</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah. So on Array, we are very excited about overall opportunity for the team. And as you know recently in May, there was communicated both very convincing updated data from the Columbus melanoma trial. The data from the second and third-line BEACON trial, which was received I think extremely well about the strong data including survival response rate of the triplet.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We're pleased that our additional trials such as the Anchor trials that served as a first trial for first-line BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC and additional trials are flours and foros [ph]<strong>,</strong> fluorescence is in BRAF-mutant melanoma, foros is in BRAF-mutant lung cancer. And we've earlier stated that we've seen opportunity actually to consider extend that to normal tissue-agnostic opportunity for BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI. So overall we see this as a very strong platform.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">As you know the Array also has a large number of partner program that will continue to advance in development and grow as products that provide a third leg of future opportunity, plus R&amp;D engine that will be added to our pipeline pending close of the deal.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">On the DMD, we presented at the parent project muscular dystrophy conference recently an update of our trial. And we continue to be optimistic about the field in general and as well looking at our aggregator safety data as well as data on muscle fiber distribution mini-dystrophin concentration and the early data we reported on NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment and creatine kinase as a muscle health marker.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We think the integrated data set are sufficiently encouraging to support the continued development of the investigational therapy. And as Albert alluded to in his introductory remarks our manufacturing including large-scale 2,000-liter bioprocessors are on track, as we continue the trial to support a potential pivotal study June next year.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Great. Thank you so much answering Mikael. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">David Risinger </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, could you please comment on the innovative business in China excluding Upjohn? What is your revenue run rate in China excluding Upjohn?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Second, with respect to Ibrance adjuvant readouts, could you please update us on the timing?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then third, with respect to U.S. biosimilars, could you update us on the expected launches in coming months? And if you have any specific timing that would be helpful. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you very much. I will cover the innovative business in China, and then I will ask Angela to cover biosimilars and the question about Ibrance. Our innovative business in China, it is approximately in the first half of the year half the size of the business. So it is in the north of $2 billion I think for the full year. If you extrapolate it is around $5 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">The business is extremely healthy. It's growing right now 26% in this quarter and the growth we expect to maintain or accelerate. We are maintaining the capabilities of the innovative business compared to the capabilities of the Upjohn have been already segregated at once. There's very little connectivity, which is mainly in enabling function systems, et cetera, but in terms of marketing, management, research and development, manufacturing all of that are already separated.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">The Biopharmaceutical business has many more resources than the Upjohn, because it's a much more demanding business, and we plan to maintain them all. And you need to know that we have a very strong research organization in China, but also we plan to maintain and enhance.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">As regards to the outlook of this business in China, we plan to launch approximately to introduce 19 new products in the next few years. So, let me take it back to Angela and also Angela if you want to make some comments about the innovative business in China, feel free, but also cover the biosimilars and the Ibrance question.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure. Sure. So, just to follow what Albert was saying, we have a strong portfolio of innovative products in China. In 2018, we have -- we saw the other listings on the NRDL of very important Oncology products. And in this year 2019, we are continuing to look forward to driving growth through the continued listing of other notable products such as Ibrance and Xeljanz, which is coming up in 2019. So, hope that just gives you a flavor of the types of launch activities that we're looking forward to and what we see as the drivers of growth.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">To your second question, which I think was about Ibrance adjuvant, those -- in that regard, we're looking forward to the two trials PENELOPE as well as PALLAS, both in the high-risk early breast cancer patients. Both of these trials, if successful will allow us to double the number of patients that we can put on Ibrance. And because these are event-driven trials, I think we've spoken about these before, we expect to report to you when the recruitment and when the numbers of patients have been finalized. But that looks like approximately sort of middle of the year next year is what we're anticipating, so more to come on that one.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And then your final question was about -- yes, biosimilars. So, as you can see to-date, all three of our monoclonal antibody biosimilars have now been approved by the FDA. So we're really pleased with that. That's a major regulatory milestone that we have accomplished. And now, we look forward to the launches. That will be coming up in short order. I don't -- I can't really give you exact dates, because as you know, there's just many things that go -- or many considerations that get factored into when a biosimilar can get launched. But I think that commensurate with the successes we've seen in these approvals, we are very much gearing up and looking forward to the launches coming up soon.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Great. Thanks Angela. Next question please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next question comes from David Maris from Wells Fargo.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">David Maris</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hi, just a simple one. The opioid litigation, can you give us an update on whether or not the opioid products are going with the Upjohn business or are they remaining with Pfizer? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Doug Lankler</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. So it's Doug Lankler. Thanks for the question. So, Upjohn has no opioid liabilities, so -- and Pfizer has a very, very small amount of them as well. But Upjohn doesn't have any, so nothing will be going in the opioid area to the new business.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. Great. Thanks Doug. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next question comes from Mani Foroohar from SBC Leerink.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Mani Foroohar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little more detail on tafamidis' and I have a follow-up after that. You've commented on 500 commercial patients, 900 on compassionate use in clinical trial, which would imply an incremental 1,600 patients outside of those two buckets to get to the 3,000 number of diagnoses that you've hopefully given to us. My question is the breakout of that population. Of the 500 commercial patients are zero or some other number from the -- of the EAP. If zero of the patient -- if zero EAP patients are in that 500 commercial, are all 400 of the EAP patients that were on EAP in December 2018 in the 900 population you disclosed today, if all 400 of those EAP patients are in that 900, when if ever will they get -- will they become commercial patients generating revenue? And then beyond that for the other 1,600 diagnosed patients, but not yet in either those two buckets, can we think about time...</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">I think we lost Mani.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your next question will come from Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Before we do that, I know we lost Mani, but let me ask Angela to answer at least the part of the question that we were able to listen to.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Okay. Great. So, just to pick up on the numbers, the 1,400 patients -- commercial patients that I referred that have been prescribed tafamidis have nothing to do with the early access program. So, the early access program has 700 patients. And of those 700 patients, 25 have already been transitioned over into commercial, but I'm not counting that as part of the 500. So that's a separate stream. So, if you think just purely newly diagnosed commercial patients who came on Vyndaqel for the first time as commercial patients that's the 500.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">There's a different stream that we need to follow for the 700 early access program getting commercialized or getting moved into commercial product. And like I said, there's 25 of those. And that's a different process that we have to work through with our clinical trial size in order to transition them, so that's they move at a slightly different pace with a different process, but we anticipate that over the next several months, all of these patients will need to be moved over.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Great. Thank you. Angela.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Chuck Triano</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you, Angela. Next question? If we can take our last question please, operator.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your final question will come from the line of Navin Jacob from Senior Research Analyst.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Navin Jacob</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Hi, sorry, Navin from UBS. Thanks for taking my question. On tafamidis -- sorry if I missed this, but Angela, is there's any color around how much usage you're getting in sort of the pure cardiomyopathy market versus any usage in the mixed phenotype market that would be great. And then just on Xeljanz, any color on just given the label change, how you're now sort of thinking about the UC market opportunity, any color on peak outlook there would be helpful? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Angela Hwang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Sure. So as you can tell, we have 500 patients that have received drug even though we've diagnosed a great deal more. So at this point it's a little difficult because we don't have enough numbers to be able to be exact with you in terms of how many are the hereditary type and how many are the wild type.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">But just order of magnitude of all the ATTR-CM patients that exist 90% of them are going to be wild type, meaning very little are hereditary. So I would anticipate that as we are diagnosing these patients that that distribution would apply. But I don't have definitive numbers on that quite yet.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">In terms of UC, so here how we're looking at it, which is that if we look at how our UC scripts are being generated today, most of them are coming from second line use, a second line after anti-TNF. So where the new label is going is in fact where -- that's in fact how our business is operating today. A large majority of our patients are our second line after anti-TNF.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">So I think that this is one where we're going to have to monitor. I think as you can imagine that there is just an incredible and a significant education effort that needs to go on now with our physicians. And I think as a result of that education method we'll get a better feel of how they are looking at UC second line. But certainly this is very much aligned with how we're doing business today anyway.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Albert Bourla</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you very much Angela. And let me make some final comments to give the highlights of the business and I want to see it from the Pfizer shareholders as well what the Pfizer shareholder is receiving.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">So first of all, our shareholders will receive 57% of a new created company. The new company will be stronger will have a great scale, great diversification, great R&amp;D and much more focused. And, of course, it will have a great capital structure. We believe that Mylan's equity is right now significantly undervalued.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Five months ago their stock was $32, which is more than $73 than were Friday's close. We have done a lot of due diligence as a responsibility for our shareholders and we feel comfortable with what we have seen.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">We do not believe the issues were related to the underlying business of the undervaluation of their stock. In fact, we discovered they have done a very good job with their pipeline and they have diversified the result -- their business. Also discovered that they have a very credible cost to control -- their cost.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">They soon were related to uncertainties around strategic direction around governance, around shareholder friendliness, and to believe that this transaction checks all boxes. This results in a materially less leverage company, robust cash flows, which facilitates payment of an attractive dividend, redomeciles company back to the U.S. in the most shareholder friendly jurisdiction, which is Delaware. And we do that with no meaningful dissynergy impacts. So there will be no tax dissynergies. And, of course, we have a strong performing governance.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Now this is what our shareholders received from us. In addition they will receive a 57% on the value of synergies of this combination will create, and of course they will receive $12 billion in cash.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">But what is more important for our shareholders, it is what -- how the remaining company Pfizer will look like. The company will be singularly focused on innovative biopharma with valuable growth assets in a strong pipeline.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">Our product portfolio and pipeline will more easily move the needle in terms of growth impact given the smaller size, which will also make the growth more sustainable.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">We anticipate remaining Pfizer's revenue CAGR on a five-year basis will improve to the high end of mid-single-digit and this will happen the moment that we close the transaction.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">We also as I said believe that the growth will be much more sustainable, given the small size and given the fact that the size goes down but all the growth assets and all the R&amp;D remains in the main company.</p>, <p class=""p p16"">And finally we will continue, of course, to have a very strong balance sheet with a solid credit rating. We believe that when you see this transaction in the context of the previous three -- actually all transactions are closing in this week or next week, which is the Therachon acquisition, we expect to close very soon the Array acquisition, we expect to close very soon the formation of the JV and we announced today this create a very different Pfizer that will be in the leadership of growth profile in top and much more bottom line. So thank you for all your questions and have a nice afternoon.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Chuck Triano</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Thank you everybody. This will conclude our call.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.</p>]"

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 23, 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Abbe Goldstein</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you so much and good morning. Welcome to Travelers discussion of our second quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three Segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of our webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Alan Schnitzer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The overall results for the quarter were solid, benefiting from the continued successful execution of our strategic agenda. We said for years that the primary measure we use for managing the business is return on equity and we've also said that any strategy to deliver leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we've previously identified impacting our industry. We established key innovation priorities and invested in capabilities consistent with those priorities. The successful execution of that strategy has contributed to growth over the past several years and contributed to the growth in earnings this quarter. Earned premiums were up 4% to almost $7 billion, adding meaningfully to underwriting income in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We've also shared that improving productivity and efficiency is a priority and efforts we've been undertaking for some time to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements are paying off. Again, this quarter and year-to-date, we've grown the top line and managed general and administrative expenses to about flat, while continuing to make important investments in the business.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">All of that, together with strong performance from our investment portfolio, contributed to core income of $537 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter and core income per diluted share of $2.02, a 12% increase over the prior year. Core return on equity was 9.2%.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In terms of underwriting margins, this quarter we delivered a solid all-in combined ratio of 98.4%. As a reminder, our expected weather losses are seasonally highest in the second quarter. But as you can see on page 4 of the webcast, the underlying combined ratio was up 1.3 points over the prior year quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">There were a number of favorable items impacting the underlying results, including a lower level of large losses and improved expense leverage. But I'd like to highlight and put in context two items contributing to the increase; non-catastrophe weather losses and some continued deterioration of trends in the tort environment.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I'll start with the weather which, of the two, had the larger impact. For the quarter, total weather losses in the aggregate, cat and non-cat, were well within the range of what we would consider normal. But breaking that down, catastrophe losses were favorable, while non-cat weather losses were worse than what we would consider a normal level for the second quarter. That resulted in a nearly 2-point increase in the underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Again, all-in weather losses weren't far off what we planned for, so we consider this bucketing.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In terms of the tort environment, the trends we discussed in the fourth quarter of last year impacting bodily injury severity in Commercial Auto have developed a little worse than we expected in the Commercial Auto line. And while we anticipated those trends extending into the other liability coverages, they extended into the primary and excess coverages of the general liability line somewhat more than we anticipated. That drove the adjustment this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">On the whole and looking back over the last three quarters, the issues continued to be most heavily associated with Commercial Auto related losses, manifesting in two places, in the Commercial Auto line, as you would expect, and also in excess coverages of the general liability line, where the underlying losses are auto related.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The run rate earnings impact of this updated view of the tort environment is a little less than $20 million per quarter after tax. The current quarter underlying result also included a catch up of about the same amount from development of the first quarter. The aggregate impact of the first and second quarter adjustments added around two-thirds-of-a-point of the consolidated underlying combined ratio, which amounts to about $0.14 per share. Also, I'll note that unlike Commercial Auto, where the returns are still clearly inadequate, the returns in the general liability line, both primary and excess are much healthier for us.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Turning to the topline. Production was once again excellent in the quarter. We grew net written premiums by 4% to a record $7.5 billion. Our premium growth reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change broadly across the portfolio. As I pointed out before, that speaks to the high quality of the business we're putting on the books. We're growing our new and renewal business with confidence in terms of accounts, geographies and industries that we know well.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In Business Insurance, we achieved renewal premium change of 6.7%, including renewal rate change of 3.6%. In both cases, the highest level since five years, while maintaining historically high levels of retention. We increased renewal rate change and renewal premium change both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines other than workers' compensation.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In our leading Bond &amp; Specialty business, we once again achieved strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses, with a record levels of retention and new business in domestic Management Liability.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In Personal Insurance, higher net written premiums benefited from renewal premium increases in both our Agency Automobile and Agency Home businesses and an all-time high for domestic new business. We have momentum in all of our businesses. And in an environment of persistently low interest rates, ongoing uncertainty surrounding weather-related losses and continuing challenges in the tort environment, we will continue to leverage the power of franchise to meet our return objectives, including by continuing to selectively and thoughtfully seek pricing and improved terms and conditions. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">To sum it up, our performance this quarter and year-to-date reflect both the successful execution of our long-term strategy and our relentless execution in the marketplace every day. With leading data and analytics in the hands of our frontline underwriters, the best talent in the industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value over time.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">And with, that I'll turn it over to Dan.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Dan Frey</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $537 million, up 9% from $494 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 9.2%, up from 8.7%. Earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 9% and 12% respectively. Our second quarter results include $367 million of pretax catastrophe losses, down from $488 million in last year's quarter, but the lower level of cat losses was more than offset by higher levels of non-cat weather.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As we have previously disclosed, our definition of catastrophes is limited to industry events where our losses exceed a specified dollar amount generally around $20 million. In the second quarter, a larger portion of the weather losses we experienced fell below our cat threshold and thus adversely impacted our underlying combined ratio. But again, as you heard from Alan, overall weather results, cat and non-cat combined were well within the range of what we would expect.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In terms of weather expectations, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that our expectations for cat losses for 2019 would trend up for two reasons. One is that we've seen growth in our premium volume and the overall exposure level in the business. Two, is that we're replacing a little more weight on recent periods and that results in a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of normal cat load per dollar premium. Adding the seasonality of our cat losses in our second quarter total weather results were no surprise.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Pretax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats in prior year reserve development decreased by 19%. Higher non-cat weather-related losses adversely impacted the underlying combined ratio of 94.9% by nearly two points compared to the prior year quarter. Also, and to a lesser degree, the change in the underlying combined ratio was impacted by several favorable items, including lower large losses and improved expense leverage, partially offset by a modest impact from the continuing challenges in the tort environment as Alan mentioned. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter was $123 million pretax, down from $186 million in the prior quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was $71 million. In terms of highlights, the net favorability resulted primarily from better-than-expected performance in workers' comp, which improved by about $275 million. Partially offsetting the favorability in workers' comp is unfavorable development of approximately $125 million in general liability for both primary and excess coverages and Commercial Auto. This represents the estimated impact of the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the nearly $20 million of after-tax run rate increase in the current quarter's underlying losses.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Second quarter PYD in Business Insurance also included a $60 million increase to environmental reserves for accident years prior to 2010. As a follow-up to last quarter, second quarter PYD also included a modest impact, resulting from a handful of additional states, extending the statute of limitations for molestation claims. The impact on our book from these legislative changes in the second quarter was much smaller than the first quarter impact from the adoption of similar legislation in New York.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, net favorable PYD of $39 million was driven by domestic Management Liability. In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $13 million was driven by favorability in our domestic businesses. Last week, the U.K. updated the Ogden rate, which is the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. The rate change was modest, and as a result we expect to book only a small benefit in the third quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Net investment income increased by 8% from the prior year quarter to $548 million after tax as higher fixed income returns were complemented by higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $25 million after tax, due to the higher-average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets. Higher returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the broader market recovery.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Looking forward with interest rate expectations now lower than they were three months ago, we have updated our outlook and now expect after-tax fixed income NII for the remainder of 2019, to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter compared to the same period a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As we discussed on our earnings calls for the last two quarters, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for PCS-designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. While the impact on written premiums was reflected entirely in the first quarter, the new treaty impacts all four quarters on an earned basis.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">For the second quarter, the impact of the treaty increased our consolidated underlying combined ratio by about 0.5 point as expected. Through June 30, we've accumulated a little less than $800 million towards the $1.3 billion retention. As you think about the elevated non-cat weather this quarter, it's important to keep in mind that much of that weather activity was from non-PCS events that did not count towards the treaty.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">On the topic of reinsurance, I'll direct your attention to page 20 of the webcast and provide an update on our catastrophe reinsurance program. The structure of our cat reinsurance treaty is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast Cat Treaty effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and flat pricing. Our cat bond Long Point Re III is in the second year of its four-year term. And in the annual reset for the 2019 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.9 billion to $1.79 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat, aggregate EXOL treaties that covers in the accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2018 10-K.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better-than-target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Net unrealized investment gains increased from $1 billion after tax as of March 31 to $1.9 billion after tax as of June 30 due to the decrease in interest rates during the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $90.05 at June 30, 3% higher than at year-end and 6% higher than the end of the second quarter last year. We returned nearly $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $217 million. On a year-to-date basis we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And with that, I'll turn the mic over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Greg Toczydlowski</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $351 million for the quarter and a combined ratio of 101.1%. The combined ratio includes catastrophe losses, which were essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 97.4% was 0.9 points higher than the prior year quarter. There are several moving pieces underneath the 0.9 point year-over-year change, so we've added page 9 to the webcast to illustrate the components.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-over-year. The most significant item was non-cat weather, which was higher than the prior year quarter by about a point. Next, are two items that we've discussed with you previously, the first is the 0.5 point impact from lower earned premium due to the new cat treaty, and the second is the approximately 0.5 point run rate impact related to the Q4 2018 re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The last of the unfavorable adjustments relates to further deterioration of the trends related to the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses in the fourth quarter as you heard from Alan. The most recent data showed loss experience that was somewhat higher than our revised expectations from the fourth quarter. This included further modest deterioration in auto and extended into general liability for both primary and excess coverage's to a higher degree than we had previously anticipated.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">For these adjustments, there is about 0.5 point of ongoing run rate impact and about 0.5 point of catch-up from the first quarter of 2019. As for the favorable year-over-year items, first, we had about 1.5 point from domestic large losses returning to a more normal level as we expected. And second, we had about 0.5 point driven by continued benefit from higher earned premium volumes and disciplined expense management. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now to the top line. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% over the prior year driven by strong underlying production results. Partially offsetting the production results were some items that were generally timing in nature. For example, we changed the timing of one of our reinsurance treaties from the first quarter to the second quarter. Adjusting for those items, the top line trends were in line with recent quarters.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6.7% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 3.6% both their highest level in five years. The renewal rate change was up 1.3 points from the first quarter and more than 1.5 points from the second quarter of last year. This is a strong result particularly given continued rate decreases in workers' comp. While the Commercial Auto and Property lines continue to lead the way, our general liability both primary and access as well as C&amp;P lines also saw meaningful increases.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases remained historically high retention of 85%. Last quarter, we said that in addition to price, we've also been focused on improving terms and conditions particularly in our property coverages. In this quarter, terms and conditions, things like deductibles, sub-limits and insurance-to-value tightened further contributing to rate adequacy.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Even after our updated view of loss trend resulting from our re-estimation of losses in the auto and general liability lines, which increased our overall view of domestic loss trend by about 0.5 point, we estimate that pricing that is rate plus the portion of exposure that acts like rate was an excess of loss trend on a written basis for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">New business of $531 million in total was essentially flat to a strong prior year quarter. We're very pleased with our production results and our continued granular and deliberate execution.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">As you heard from Alan, given the low interest rate environment, continued uncertainty around weather-related losses and some upward pressure from the tort environment, we'll continue to seek rate and use all the other available levers to meet our return objectives. As for the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change, the renewal rate change both ticked up from the first quarter, while retention remained strong at 82%.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">New business was strong in comparable to the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the returns in this business and these production results reflect our strategic execution.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In middle market, renewal premium change was 6.1% with renewal rate of 3.4%, up more than a point from the first quarter and 1.6 points from the second quarter of last year, while retention remained historically high at 87%.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">New business premiums of $275 million were down from a strong prior year quarter. For the most part, we attribute the new business dynamic to our underwriters prioritizing improving price, terms and conditions at renewal and being disciplined in managing risk selection related to our exposure to the auto line. We're very comfortable with our execution. We continue to invest in our strategic capabilities and are confident that we're well positioned to profitably grow over time.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Page 18 of the webcast shows production statistics for our international markets across all three of Travelers' segments. Although, these statistics include more than Business Insurance, the overall trends are consistent with what we're seeing for the BI portion of international and reflect the rate risk selection, risk control and other measures we continue to execute to improve profitability.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Lastly, I'd like to touch on our National Property business, which had a notable increase in new business this quarter. In this space, we've been seeing more opportunities in the marketplace and we've been selectively writing some of that. Importantly, many are accounts that we quoted or written before, so we're familiar with them and we're writing them at prices and on terms and conditions that meet our discipline standards.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Tom Kunkel</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks, Greg. Bond &amp; Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment income was $174 million, a decrease of $30 million due to a lower level of net favorable prior year development. The combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 74.9% and 81% respectively.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Net written premiums for the quarter were up a very strong 9% with solid growth across all businesses. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are pleased that the domestic retention remained at a historically high 90% with renewal premium change higher at 4.2%.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">New business for the quarter was a record $65 million, up 20% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect a successful execution of our various marketing, product and underwriting strategies to profitably grow these lines.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Domestic Surety net written premiums were up 4% over a very strong prior year quarter. Our existing portfolio remains well positioned to continue to provide leading returns over time and our competitive advantages allow us to thoughtfully and selectively add quality new accounts. So Bond &amp; Specialty results were strong and we feel terrific about our marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue to deliver excellent results.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Michael Klein</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance grew income, revenue and policies in force in the second quarter with improved performance in both auto and home.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Segment income for the second quarter of 2019 increased $105 million relative to the second quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.2% an improvement of 4.7 points over the prior quarter, driven primarily by catastrophe levels that were nearly 7 points below last year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter driven by an increase in non-catastrophe weather losses and the impact on earned premiums related to the new Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty partially offset by earned pricing net exceeded loss trend in agency automobile and a lower underwriting expense ratio.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Weather losses in the aggregate were better than the prior year quarter and we're pleased with the overall results. Recall that the second quarter is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of expected weather losses.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter grew 6% with Agency Homeowners &amp; Other leading the way with growth of 11%. Personal Insurance had strong retention in renewal premium change and record new -- domestic new business for the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Agency Automobile once again delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 94% for the quarter, a 1.4 point improvement from the prior year period. The quarter benefited from a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio continued to benefit from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend including continued favorable frequency trends.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In Agency Homeowners &amp; Other the second quarter combined ratio was 104.5%, 9.1 points lower than the prior quarter due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net -- favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Higher non-catastrophe weather losses were the main driver of the 7.7 point increase in the underlying combined ratio to 92.9% as compared to the prior year quarter. While weather in total was favorable relative to the prior year quarter, a significant component of the weather activity came from non-PCS events this quarter in addition to PCS events that did not meet our catastrophe threshold.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Turning to quarterly production. Agency Automobile retention remained solid at 84% with renewal premium change of 4.6% and a modest increase in new business from the prior year quarter. We remain focused on actions to grow this book at returns that continue to meet our objectives.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Agency Homeowners &amp; Other delivered another strong quarter. We achieved renewal premium change of 6.7% up 1.4 points from the first quarter and up 3 points from the second quarter of last year with retention remaining strong at 86%. The pricing we achieved reflects actions we're taking to address the higher loss activity that we and the industry have experienced in recent periods.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">New business was up 26% driven by our successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. QH2 continues to be well received and is performing as expected driven by sophisticated pricing segmentation and the ability for agents and customers to easily tailor the product to meet their needs.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">During the quarter we continue to make investments in the business. For example, we rolled out QH2.0 in three more states and the District of Colombia and QH2 is now available in 28 states. We remain on-track to complete the rollout in most of the remaining states later this year.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">In addition we announced several new initiatives. First, we've partnered with American Forests, the oldest National Conservation Organization in the U.S. to plant up to one million trees in connection with our initiative to encourage more customers to enroll in paperless billing, resulting in more efficiency for us, a better experience for them all while benefiting the environment.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Second we're working with Wildfire Defense Systems to help provide loss prevention services in California that supplement local firefighters and other first responders in the event of a wildfire.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">This new service gives California policyholders an added layer of wildfire protection at no additional premium. It is also an additional tool to help us manage our exposure. These are the latest examples of initiatives that continue to position us well to deliver value in the eyes of the customer and to grow profitably while investing in the business.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Abbe Goldstein</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Michael. And thank you. We're ready to begin Q&amp;A.</p>, <p class=""p p8"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks and good morning. I'm sure people are going to have a fair amount of questions on the underlying combined ratio shift in 2Q year-over-year. I really think you explained it well in terms of the impact of non-cat weather and the tort environment deteriorating.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I am wondering given the pace of price improvement, do you think at some point over the course of the rest of 2019 or 2020, we could see underlying margin improvement given how those trends are unfolding?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">You know, Jay, we give you an outlook for the underlying underwriting margin in the Outlook section of the 10-Q and we do it by segment. So you can see there -- what it is that we're thinking going forward. In particular where -- in BI where we're calling for continued improvement really it's three things it's non-cat weather, it's -- we would expect improved results in international.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And in the fourth quarter of last year you've got the timing impact of the fourth quarter auto adjustments, but there is a lot of levers we have to pull to manage overall margins and profitability and including price terms and conditions and we're working on all those things relentlessly in the market every day and that will impact premium that we put on books and that also will earn in over time.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">All right. That's helpful. Thanks. All right so expectations of continued improvement. And then I was wondering if you might have the rate impact or the rate benefit in domestic Business Insurance excluding the -- what I would imagine is a drag from workers' comp?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, Jay workers’ comp continued to be negative in the quarter. And we have given that as a separate statistic from time-to-time. We do it when we think it's relevant and we need to do it to clarify one thing or another. But there is some competitive sensitivity there and we don't intend to continue to update that number and probably would prefer not to give it to you now. But clearly the numbers that you see for rate in RPC and BI would be higher, but for workers' comp which is negative.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">That’s helpful. Thanks very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Jay.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Your next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Phillips</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. First on the personal line side Agency Auto. I'm sure you saw a pretty decent expansion there of your core margin. And if I am reading correctly it sounds like your outlook calls for consistent levels of profitability into 2020. So I guess, could you talk about what you're seeing on the competitive environment sounds like it might be more competitive now than it was last year and sounds like if you're looking for consistent -- what is the profitability you're not concerned then with any rising in physical damage severity impacts in your margins there?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Klein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sure, Mike. This is Michael Klein. I would say on the competitive environment we talked about it the last couple of quarters we certainly see as you can also find a moderation in rate increases being filed by our competitors. I think broadly speaking it's in pattern with the methods that we've been sending that we're moderating rate in response to the improved profitability. And I think we're working to be in step with the marketplace there.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">In terms of loss trend, we do continue to see upward pressure on severity in personal auto more than offset over the last couple of quarters with improvements in frequency. I think what we're working to do is to balance our pricing with the long-term view or trend over time and the outlook reflects the fact that we think we can do that and shift a little bit more growth in auto at attractive margins. So that's the view on our outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">The one exception inside the outlook you'll note that we talk about the fourth quarter in particular and so I'll just remind you that as you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 and the comparison to 2018 there is a challenging year-over-year comparison there because we had both very strong quarter in terms of profitability in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized some of the favorable loss trend that we had been seeing throughout 2018. So there was a good guide catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. So broadly consistent with the exception of the fourth quarter which is really just a year-over-year comparison challenge.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Phillips</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. Great. Thank you, Michael for the details there. Switching over then to workers comp you mentioned this time reserve development was from multiple accident years. I guess, one was there anything from accident year 2018 and anything from the first quarter of 2019 in that? And then, I guess, secondly on comp -- some competitors were talking about changing in loss trends maybe slightly getting worse and California recently came up with some uptick in severity in California. So I guess at what point do you become concerned on pretty substantial margin pressure in that line?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dan Frey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So Mike, its Dan Frey. I'll take at least the first part of it on PYD, sort of, to clarify right so there wouldn't be anything in PYD from the first quarter of 2019. We'd count that as current year and we'd have called it out if there was a significant catch-up there. You k now, with the long-tail nature of workers' comp the majority of our prior year reserves development is going to have to come from years prior to 2018 just because you have a better chance to see how those were seasoning, but there is a small piece from 2018 as we see the favorability in some of the older years continue to bid into 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Mike, its Alan. On the loss trend of workers' comp -- I'd say broadly speaking it continues to behave well.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Phillips</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. First, probably for Greg. In your prepared commentary, I believe you said in addition to price you're getting tightened terms and conditions. If that's correct just want to clarify whether your disclosure of pricing changes is taking into account terms and conditions tightening as well?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Toczydlowski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. Terms and conditions is all net inside our book of business yield. When we talk about terms and conditions, we're predominantly seeing that on the larger portion of the property segment. So think insured value, thing deductibles, all peril deductibles, sub-limits, so that's where we're seeing some of those terms and conditions improvement. So as we make those changes on the renewal block that certainly has an impact from a favorable point of view from a loss cost net on the book of business.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Mike are you asking whether that's somehow adjusted in the rate number, is that your question?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. If it's mathematically taken into account within the disclosure rate.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">It's not mathematic, I mean the rate numbers are pretty pure just price calculation, although to some extent it could show up on the exposure side, right? So if deductibles went up for example that would be negative for exposure, but it would not factor into the pure rate calculation.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. That's helpful. I may follow-up. And lastly on tort inflation, would you say it's gaining momentum in terms of the inflation rates? And do you think there are any underlying causes, I believe litigation finance there is a bunch of – there’s couple of public firms and there's been a lot of capital raises there over the last couple of years and its gaining momentum as an asset class maybe that's one of the underlying drivers. If you have any thoughts there that would be helpful? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. So it's -- so what we're describing is the result of squaring triangles and coming up with numbers and then looking for causal factors in the environment. So there's a fair amount of estimation here and it's not -- there is no math formula that gets us to the answer to that question necessarily.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But I would say broadly what we're reflecting in our numbers, we would describe it as a more active and more aggressive plaintiffs' bar. Now litigation finance is its own topic and we certainly read about, we can see numbers on that. We know more money is being raised for that as an asset class. We don't dismiss that as a factor.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I will tell you that that is one aspect that at least now, this could change but at least now we're not seeing that as a particularly significant driver in what we're referring to as change in the tort environment. That could come. I mean we see the funds being raised for that. And so -- and by the way to the extent we see that and anticipate it that would get reflected in our loss PIKs as well, but we're not seeing that as a standout issue.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, good morning. My first question going back to the Commercial Auto and GL PIKs that went up in the quarter. I guess what I'm trying to tie together is, A; the increase that you guys saw there and then also the commensurate increase in rate. So do you -- can you try to bucket I guess, how much of the rate was driven in your view off of just this higher loss trend environment because when we think about going forward it does sound like you guys are a bit more positive on pricing inflecting relative to loss trend in terms of just thinking about your outlook but if trend keeps going up that's going to, obviously, offset that rate versus trend phenomena?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yeah. So, Elyse we did give you some perspective on outlook for RPC in the Outlook section of the 10-Q. And certainly everything we know about loss trend goes into our pricing models and our view of rate adequacy and our view what rate we need to achieve our return objectives.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I will say that that does come in on a lag basis. We've got to see it, we've got to put it through in our models to the extent there are regulatory filings there's a process there then you got to put it on the book it's got a earn in. So there is a lag between the recognition of these trends and the time price goes into the market and gets -- is put on the books.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So it's a long way of saying that Commercial Auto was at an inadequate return before we saw some of these trends it just got worse. And I think to a large degree, the pricing that we're seeing now is reflective of longer term trends in Commercial Auto, although some of what we're seeing in the quarter will be reflective of recent trends.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. And then my second question, so you guys said the increase PIKs are about $20 million going forward that's about 50 basis points within Business Insurance. I know there is two buckets one being Commercial Auto and then one being the GL portion, but you guys did increase your Commercial Auto PIKs two quarters ago in the fourth quarter. So I’m just trying to get a sense, the conservatism that you guys have now that this has been addressed and why -- maybe instead of half a point it's not one point that you chose to increase to your loss PIKs in the current quarter?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yeah. Elyse our objective isn't missed at high or low. Our objective is always to get it right. We're trying to come up with an estimate of losses. We price the product based on an estimate of losses and an interest rate curve. And so our objective is always to get the right price. And so we weighed through a lot of data. We've got terrific actuaries and experts that help us think through this we've got management input on top of that. And our objective is to just get it right. So can we tell you, boy we swung a big stick at it and we're done this is it. No, we can't. But we can tell you that based on everything we see in the data. And based on our experience we think we got the PIKs in the right place.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question comes from Bijan Moazami with Compass Point Research. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Bijan Moazami</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I want to understand a little bit more what's going on in the Commercial Auto business. In particular, you guys picked up a fair amount of premium volume this year and last year was it all great or was it something else?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And this big pick up in BI severity is that broad-based? Or is it related to a subsection of the Commercial Auto or is it geographically located?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Toczydlowski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. This is Greg. Yes, Commercial Auto as you can see in the quarter, we had an 8% change in net written premium. The predominant dynamic underneath that is broad RPC across the portfolio.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We're clearly seeing the Commercial Auto challenges that we believe the industry is also. So it really isn't a segment of the book. It's a broad dynamic and hence the reason why we've been achieving RPC, so broadly across it.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Bijan Moazami</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. And then, regarding your $60 million reserve chart for environmental liability, I assume this is all pre-1986 and what's going on there?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Daniel Frey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey It's Dan. I am not sure that it goes all back as far as pre-1986. It certainly in the year -- action years older than 2009, it's really a continuation of what we have seen in environmental over the last several years.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We do see an improving environment in terms of the number of claims that come in. Because it is old, we do expect it's a runoff. The reaction here in this quarter is simply that things have not improved quite to the degree that we would have anticipated in our prior PIK.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So you're right to think about this as mostly very old stuff. You're right to think about it as generally improving over time in terms of the volume of these things slowing down it just hasn't slowed quite to the degree that we had previously expected.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Bijan Moazami</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hey thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the renewal rate number sequentially. And I'm trying to get a feel for maybe how much of that increase just had to do with the mix of the premium that you wrote in the second quarter versus the first.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Because I noticed that there was less workers' comp or you're obviously not getting rate but there is a lot more property, where I'm guessing the rate is better in the 3.6%.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So is there anyway to kind of tease out the impact of just control for mix in that 3.6% versus the -- or the 130 basis point increase sequentially?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Toczydlowski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Ryan, this is Greg again. Comp wasn't off materially. And obviously every month we pride ourselves in our pricing to the local execution very granular partnership with our distributions.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So it depends on the accounts that are coming up, the loss experience that's associated with them. And we do our best in partnering with them, but can't really say that there was a comp dynamic drive and that it was really the exposures that came up for renewal.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And the exposure increase in workers' comp is it fair to kind of use the exposure increase for all of BI as a good barometer of what you're seeing in comp too?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">No. Not necessarily. And we don't disclose comp at that level, but not necessarily. But Ryan, I'm looking here for the data. My instinct is that there's not a big mix factor driving the overall rate change.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. That's helpful. And then Alan was my follow-up was particularly on interest rates. First, I'm curious what the new money yield is today for the company? And then second of all, just thinking about buybacks versus where the stocks trading, like I haven't seen it trade at this price-to-book valuation in quite some time.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And I know, Alan you've always talked about structural returns in this business being linked to a certain extent to wherever interest rates are. And I guess we're back to very low levels of interest rates. So I'm curious looking into the back half of the year has your appetite for buybacks changed at all?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Ryan, let me start with the buyback. And then I'll see if Bill wants to comment on the new money yields. But in terms of buybacks, our first objective for every dollar of capital that we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and generate a return for it.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And when we can, we're going to give it back to investors. And our alternative is to put that fixed income bond portfolio. And we don't think that's what our investors expect us to do. As between dividends and buybacks, we think, by and large buybacks is the preferred solution it's less diluted to book value per share.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And so we're not trading in the stock. We're rightsizing capital. And we'll continue to do that. Of course we wouldn't be buying back stock. We thought the stock was trading at above intrinsic value and we don't.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, this really is -- it's not tactical. We're rightsizing capital. And it's a strategy to deliver shareholder value. And over the last 10 or 12 years we get this question from time-to-time when depending on where the stock is trading.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And so this has come as a concern before or at least as a question before maybe not a concern. And I would just point out, since '06 we bought back something like $35 million worth of stock and at an average price per share of I think $66 or $67 a share. So we feel pretty good that we've bought the stock back thoughtfully in a way that's create -- created shareholder value and no change in our philosophy. Bill, do you want to comment on new money?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Bill Heyman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Ryan in terms of new money yields, in the second quarter the new money yield was between 3% and 3.25%. It ended the quarter what was the bottom of that range and it's probably about there now. We think more in terms of the relationship between new money yields and mature yields. And obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year we were reinvesting at book yields comfortably above money running off. We were above in this first quarter, but less so, but obviously in the second quarter we slipped below and rates were at the lowest point in that cycle.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">To measure the gap and on a daily basis, it's random, so we do it over periods. We look at the curve and spreads. We look at what is running off. We look at the mix of assets we're buying, which also changes. And we also look at sales we're making in the market, and we do make some sales, especially in areas where the tax reform act changed the profitability to us of certain products. I can tell you that the gap as we measure it is in excess of 50 basis points and can run higher than that.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And Ryan the net effect of everything built this year was in the outlook for NII that Dan shared in his prepared remarks and that's in the outlook section of the 10-Q. So that would all be reflected in that number.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Pardon me, good morning. So quick question I guess on the workers' compensation reserve release. It's on a perfect comparison, but Schedule P showed $625 million-or-so of releases in full year 2018 for workers' compensation. So it seems like the pace is picking up and I was wondering is that because of more conservative PIKs or incrementally better observed loss trends?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dan Frey</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hi. It's Dan. I wouldn't say more conservative loss PIKs. I would say, we're simply doing what we always do which is every quarter we're going to go through all the data as it comes in relative to the expectations that we had in the previous set of PIKs. Clearly, we've moved over time favorably in prior year reserve development in workers' comp.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We do take those things and reflect them in our most recent views. What you see this quarter is simply another quarter's worth of data where things have come in more favorably than what we would have embedded in the prior PIK. I don't think this is in anyway the unwinding of some increase in conservatism in prior PIKs.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess this is for Michael. When we -- if we take out the Personal Auto and Agency Homeowners from total personal lines, it seems like the remainder, the direct-to-consumer and international actually saw about 200 basis point in the quarter loss ratio on a year-over-year basis, excluding catastrophes and reserve development. Is that mix? Is that international?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Klein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">So we obviously disclosed the segment, we disclosed the components and you're talking about the delta. I would say, -- and we sort of talked about this in past quarters, the Canada -- the international book, which is predominantly Ontario auto, but broadly Canada has been underperforming. We're being impacted there by similar trends and experience that you've heard others in the industry talk about. We've got a game plan to work to improve that, but it's a challenging environment.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">I will say on a positive note, we've got the seven point rate increase approved by Ontario earlier this year. We have another rate increase on file with the regulators as we speak. And through that and some distribution management and underwriting actions, we're working to improve the performance there. But yeah, the delta there is really a drag primarily from international.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Good morning. Going to the rate improvement in Business Insurance, so I think you said that it's currently in excess of loss trends on a written basis. Considering the fact that loss trends have moved up over the last couple of quarters at least, I guess, what quarter was the inflection point in terms of achieving rate in excess of trends?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah. Yaron, that's a hard one to pick here on the fly. We're talking about going back and looking at it. We've said for a few quarters that they were close one way or the other, a couple of quarters ago when we said, written was a little bit ahead of trend. It was -- now based on our new view, it's probably a little bit behind trend. Exactly what quarter-to-date the inflection point is hard to pick. There is a lot of estimation in all of it.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We can tell you that as you heard Greg say in his prepared remarks, where we are today and it's not just rate, it's rate and exposure. Where we are today even taking into account our updated view of loss trend we feel like on a return basis, we're expanding margins.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we turn to homeowners, so the deterioration in the loss ratio comes in the face of strong net premiums written growth and the quantum to product and in-home. Is the quantum product and is the growth strategy performing as expected? And is it just a matter of severe non-cat weather that's kind of thrown a wrinkle this quarter or -- I want to stop there.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Klein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure, and this is Michael. I would say the short answer to your question is yes, the Quantum Home 2.0 product is performing as expected as we monitor the loss experience there and in particular the data that's most credible still at this early stages is frequency, but the loss experience is performing as we expected in the product. And in this quarter really the miss on underlying is actually more than explained by the non-cat weather variance.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">I will take a step back and just talk to you sort of more broadly about homeowners profitability and just remind everybody that we have been talking about a bit of pressure on underlying loss experience in property some of that weather-related, some of that non-weather water-related. And while non-weather water wasn't a significant impact this quarter, it doesn't mean it's gone away. And so that's behind my comments about continuing to drive for price change in homeowners in order to address some of those underlying profitability challenges. But again, we think it's really weather-related and a little bit of non-weather water-related less about the product itself.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Got it. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Michael Klein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Kumar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks and good morning. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the total climate. The first question I have is what should give us confidence that I guess adverse trend line will not spread across other segments. Is it more so the inherent I guess nature of Commercial Auto which leaves it open to the plaintiffs' bar chasing it? Or what else is going on, on a bit more deeper basis?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Amit, I think we have said in prior quarters that we do see this thematically across liability lines. So whether it's bodily injury severity in personal auto or whether it's the CMP product or -- we have said we see it broadly. But we've also said that this is driven by a Commercial Auto underlying dynamic and the reason -- and I think we went into this a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the reason is there's a high degree of homogeneity to those losses.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And so in terms of the plaintiffs' bars business model, there is just a lot of attractiveness to that as compared to other claims. Slip and fall for example, where it's going to be highly dependent or -- anyway more dependent on facts and circumstances and it's a little bit more complicated to litigate. But again, as we've said in the past, we do see this thematically and we are taking that into account in all of our loss PIKs. Just so far, it's been for the most part a Commercial Auto dynamic.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Kumar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Got it. The second question and my only question is, if you look at the pass trend lines and I think all of us have lived through adverse total climate, is your margin guidance -- is the thought process that it stabilizes here or are we at an inflection point? Or what should give us confidence that this does not deteriorate or continue to deteriorate further and then sort of swing back? I mean, how do we think about the inflection point here on this slide? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Amit, Greg did say in his prepared remarks that we did increase our loss PIKs for BI as a consequence of what we're hearing. So we are -- we think that the starting point was higher and the inflation rate from here is higher. As I said in my answer to a prior question, do we think we've taken care of all of this? We think so otherwise we would have done something different. Having said that, we're not trying to be aggressive or conservative. We're trying to get it right. Our loss estimates or yield losses go into our pricing. And so it's important that we sharpen the pencil and put our very best estimate on it and that's what we've done.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">And I think you can look back over some number of years in our business and our track record and whether it's in Commercial Auto or whether it's in Personal Auto or other issues, this is insurance loss estimates and underlying loss, I'm sure are going to change. And all you can hope is that you've got the right data, the right analytics, the right experience and the right expertise to see it and react to it. And we think if you look back over time in our business, we've done a pretty good job of reacting to that. And this -- it's unfortunate when it happens, but that's the business we're in and we think that we've done all the right things.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Amit Kumar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">I got the answer I was looking for. Thank you so much and good luck for the future.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thanks, Amit.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yes. Thanks, Alan. I'm just curious here. Looking at the middle market, new business down year-over-year, little bit of deterioration to retentions, are you guys starting to dig in your heels a little bit more right now just on pricing in terms and conditions? Maybe kind of like we start to see happen back in 2011. Greg, it doesn't seems like an extreme situation. But is that -- should we expect kind of new business to continue to kind of be more challenging here going forward maybe retention start to deteriorate a little bit?</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Toczydlowski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Hey Brian, this is Greg. First, when you do that math, you're looking down from a really strong period in the prior year and we've shared with you in the past all those strategic initiatives we've been executing in the business really to free up our underwriters and give them more capacity to be active in the marketplace. The word active, we'll use based on different environments in the business.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">Right now, active is really addressing what you said making sure that we do have the right terms and conditions and most importantly, the right adequate price on the product. And so, our underwriters have been using a lot of that capacity right now to improve the margins on the business and we think in terms of the book of business and your question on retention, we think it's a really high-quality book of business. And we do everything possible to work with our distributors to try to keep those retention levels up there while improving the margins on the business also.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alan Schnitzer</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">I would like to point out 2011 was a very different environment in terms of where we were in terms of rate adequacy and returns. So, it's difficult to draw a comparison. Every point in the cycle is different and I'm not sure there's a lot of comparison.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Got you, got you. And then, second question just quickly here. I know you guys are in Q2, but you do have an excess surplus line through a non-admitted carrier. Can you give us any differentiation between those two markets as far as what you're seeing happening in non-admitted versus admitted? What you're seeing...</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Toczydlowski</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Yes Brian, this is Greg again. Sure. We see some of the industry statistics also where there has been an uptick in some of the larger states from a non-admitted point of view. Just as a reminder, we have two areas where we write non-admitted business. One in our north field business which is a less complex solution, a smaller business exposure you can think of it that way. And then we also use the non-admitted business across our property book of business. But as you said, certainly not a real big part of our product strategy. And that's because, we think, we've got really modular and customized product offerings and what we need to do to address terms and conditions in this market, our product portfolio has been able to do that. So, we've been comfortable with that portfolio mix.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong><span class=""question"">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">We have completed the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Abbe Goldstein</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. As always, if you have any follow-up, please feel free to get in touch with Investor Relations and have a good day.</p>, <p class=""p p16""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p16"">This concludes today's conference call.

Please go ahead. </p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>David Wichmann</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong well balanced revenue and earnings growth across our businesses, continuing trends of the last several years. We have considerable momentum, improving the consumer position and customer experience, applying rigorous net promoter disciplines within a culture built to serve people's most fundamental need their health. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">Executing on our mission, helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone, produces value for people, the health system and society, overall, and strong returns for our shareholders. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">In the first half of 2019 total revenues grew year-over-year by 9%, or $9.6 billion to $121 billion. Adjusted earnings per share advanced 18%. Both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributed strongly to these results, generating total enterprise operating cash flows of $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net earnings. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">Confidence in our ability to continue to advance our fundamental performance and profitable growth leads us to increase our outlook for full year adjusted earnings to a new range of $17.40 -- $14.70 to $14.90 per share. We are constantly developing and refining our differentiated set of core capabilities, enriching, integrating and applying deep proprietary information sets to improve engagement and clinical decision making, embedding modern analytics and technologies across the system to make it more interoperable, transparent and efficient. And expanding the scope and effectiveness of our clinical capacities, and aligning with others to value based incentives to improve health outcomes while lowering costs.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As we work in partnership with the care community and others, these competencies enable us to develop the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. You can see the latest evidence of our progress on a number of fronts, our recently completed combination with DaVita Medical Group meaningfully expands Optum Care’s nationwide network of physicians. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">The John Muir Health strategic relationship announced yesterday is unique and expressive services and demonstrates the roll Optum can play when it’s fully aligned with its customers, serving the needs of local communities.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Continued OptumRx gains in employer health plan and coalition markets reflect the distinctive more wide ranging and more modern consumer approaches OptumRx applies to deliver value addressing one of the most challenging burdens of healthcare, excessive drugs and biologic costs. The first 20 million real time interoperable individual health records are being scheduled for market deployment. We remain optimistic about the potential of these deeply personalized health records, and associated next best action recommendations to improve the health of people we serve and the overall system performance.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Consumer engagement aligned to this actionable health information plays a critical role in developing the next generation health system. By the end of this year, Raleigh’s [ph] digital engagement capacities will be available to nearly 20% of the U.S. population, solidifying its opportunity to advance individual health at scale.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Physician data sharing and value-based incentives round out a true end-to-end alignment of a progressive health system. Value Based payments to care providers are growing at more than 15% in 2019, aligning incentives to practice high quality care, while improving the effective use of health system resources. We expect these value-based payments to ramp at an even more accelerated pace in the coming years.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">All of these and the examples offered by our business leaders today are only a partial reflection of the steady progress we are making in advancing our enterprise mission to make healthcare work for everyone, so everyone can live healthier lives. The results are compelling. We are lowering costs trends, steadily improving NPS, and achieving improved clinical outcomes, leading to continued long-term sustainable performance and growth for our business.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">With that, I'll now turn to UnitedHealthcare's new Chief Executive Officer, Dirk McMahon. Most of you know Dirk from when he was first joined UnitedHealthcare in 2003. Having worked in major leadership roles at UnitedHealthcare, Optum and UnitedHealth Group he notes firsthand how to maximize the full capabilities of this enterprise, including the clinical capacities of Optum Health, the data insights and advanced technologies of OptumInsight and the distinguished pharmacy care solutions offered by OptumRx. Dirk?</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Dirk McMahon</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thank you, Dave. Glad to be back at UnitedHealthcare. I'm pleased with what I've seen in the first few weeks in the role, we don't need a major shift in direction, but we will sharpen our focus on delivering consistent growth performance across all market segments. An essential step to drive growth is consistently achieving superior operating and middle co-cost structures. Cost impacts member health when it is a barrier to getting care, and we need to address that even better for people. It’s the primary driver of consumer satisfaction in NPS. When we improve satisfaction in NPS we drive growth.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We’ll continue our intense focus on simplifying and improving the experience for people. Using our digital platforms and applications, we can improve our ability to help people navigate the complexities of healthcare and get people on effective care pathways. This creates a better clinical and service experience, which leads to better outcomes, cost containment and satisfied members.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Some of the essential elements of this include, better information sharing with consumers and their doctors, creating aligned incentives among consumers, care providers in Unitedhealthcare, tailoring products to consumer needs, providing digital and human navigators to support consumers in their health and care journeys and offering practical technology at key decision points.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Simplicity is vital to making healthcare easier, our Navigate4Me offering simplifies and personalizes care for seniors with complex conditions. It provides them with a single point of contact for concierge services, and a dedicated team of experts, supported by a proprietary technology platform with integrated data, navigators help coordinate care through personalized care plans and address social determinacy.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Results have been positive, with a 14% reduction in hospitalizations, and a 9% reduction in ER visits for patients with congestive heart failure. Navigate4Me dramatically improves NPS, now nearly 20 points higher than traditional approaches. With nearly 1000 Navigators now in place, we will continue to expand appointment and impact over the coming quarters. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">We have created simplified paths, enabling doctors to provide high quality surgical procedures and ambulatory settings. These can be less than half the cost of traditional inpatient settings, with higher quality outcomes and greater consumer satisfaction. And, our recently launched preferred lab networks create paths for patients and -- physicians and patients to use to lower costs testing facilities, make it easier to order labs electronically, and provide turnaround times to results. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">From these examples and more across inpatient and outpatient services, we see an opportunity for more than 20 billion in potential annual savings in spend, managed by United Healthcare’s employer and individual business alone and reducing unwanted variations in care, converting care to the most appropriate side of service and aligning with high performing delivery systems.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">We continue to diversify and extend our employer and individual business, organizing local systems of care physically, virtually and digitally, building collaborative relationships with care providers and sharing data by directionally with them and innovating around product designs. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">For example, our partnership with Centura Health announced last year in the Colorado Doctors plan is achieving price points 20% lower than our broad access offerings. Some of the attributes driving this success include the use of effective referral patterns, timely texting with alternative care options when a patient registers at the emergency room and virtual appointment. This is the type of total cost of care product innovation you should expect from us.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Likewise at community and state, medical costs and operational improvements are advancing nicely as planned. And on the growth front, we're preparing to serve more people later this year with our recently awarded North Carolina opportunity.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our businesses serving people who are duly eligible for Medicaid and Medicare continue to expand and perform well. The outlook for further growth in this category, and more broadly in the group and individual Medicare Advantage remains exceptional. Year-over-year, we've grown by more than 540,000 people across these important areas greater than 10%. We see significant macro revenue growth opportunities in these categories for years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As such, we will continue to invest in many ways ranging from stable benefits to better coordination of care. For example, in 2020, we will provide all duly eligible members with a personal care coordinator to help manage their Medicaid and Medicare benefits and coordinate clinical needs, such as appointment scheduling, filling prescriptions and closing gaps in care.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">UnitedHealthcare’s financial performance continues to be strong. Revenues grew 6% to $48.6 billion, while operating earnings advanced 12% to $2.6 billion in the quarter. I'm looking forward to working with our team to further elevate UnitedHealthcare’s performance from the strong position we hold today, delivering more value across multiple dimensions in healthcare.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now, let me turn it over to Andrew Witty, Chief Executive Officer of Optum.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Andrew Witty</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, Dirk. At Optum, we’re developing and building a broad set of capabilities, supporting a vision for providing better healthcare and increased affordability for more people. This compels us to rethink healthcare can be provided more holistically across the broad and changing healthcare landscape. One significant opportunity for improvement comes in chronic disease care. The 30 million people in the U.S. with three or more chronic diseases account for two-thirds of healthcare spending today, and the number of people is expected to grow to 80 million by 2030. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Managing these chronic patients requires a multidisciplinary hands on approach Optum building in its next generation condition management programs. These include the management of emerging high cost specialty drugs, which are expected to continue to be a leading driver of medical costs inflation.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We address these trends through a broad range of approaches, including direct delivery of home and office infusion services, and direct delivery of specialty pharmacy prescriptions to the home with digital care services provided by Optum pharmacist to educate patients on how to properly take their medication.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Another challenge Optum is meeting head on is a dramatic rise in oncology drug spending. In the U.S. health system, misaligned incentives lead to administering higher cost oncology drugs unnecessarily. We do think there's a better way. Early results from our integrated OptumCare Cancer Center in Nevada suggests a decoupling oncology drug payments from Dr. Compensation can reduce pharmaceutical spending for seniors by nearly 30%.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">It drives improved clinical quality based on the best science, while keeping the patients comfort, care and dignity as the highest priority. And ensuring physicians administering the care are paid fairly for their excellent work. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">We're exploring other new approaches along therapeutic lines such as chronic heart failure, and musculoskeletal conditions to more comprehensively address care needs of those with significant health challenges. The right delivery of care by physicians would be pivotal to this agenda, as OptumCare seeks to coordinate each patient's care journey with a focus on proactive, preventive medicine, especially for those with the most acute need.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Creating value for those we serve translates the stronger financial performance. Over just the last three years, the revenue per consumer served by OptumHealth has grown by nearly 50%. In the quarter OptumHealth total revenue grew 20% to $7.1 billion, while operating earnings advanced 21% to $688 million. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">Like OptumHealth, OptumInsight’s positioning and capabilities have evolved over many years. OptumInsight has advanced from what was once primarily a point solution provider of technology to diversified enterprise solutions organization. The business has deep and broad expertise to solve some of the biggest challenges in healthcare for payers, providers, life science companies and governments.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our new multi-year relationship with John Muir Health is distinctive in its comprehensive nature. John Muir is nationally recognized for quality of care as a major independent health system in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our relationship, funds revenue cycle, information technology, ambulatory care coordination, analytics procurement and consulting services.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">The partnership will deliver broad performance improvement at John Muir and for its patients and physicians. With this another new relationship OptumInsight’s second quarter backlog grew 20% year-over-year or more than $3 billion to $18.5 billion. Revenues advanced 7% to $2.3 billion and operating income increased 16% to $525 million.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">OptumRx continues to evolve from a traditional PBM to a diversified pharmacy care services organization deeply focused clinically and enabled by vast data and ever improving technologies. This quarter we introduced a new and transparent digital consumer pricing tool. MyScript finder puts lower cost pharmaceutical alternatives and coverage status at people's fingertips. It offers instantaneous consumer relevant cost transparency with actual out of pocket costs based on pharmacy location, benefit plan design and deductible status. So far, consumers have conducted over 1 million searches in the first 60 days of usage.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">OptumRx continue to win in the market. Its value is resonating with health plans, large employers and purchasing coalitions. We’re driving greater pharmacy and medical care alignment, better service quality, lower costs, improved transparency, and an expanding breadth of services at the local market level, including home infusion, e-commerce specialty and community based dispensing services. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">As a result, OptumRx continues to profitably expand share. In the second quarter, revenues advanced by 12% to $18.9 billion and OptumRx added $11 million adjusted scripts year-over-year. These are just a few examples of the progress we've made and how the Optum businesses are advancing the way they serve in both their individual and market segments. And together as they deploy broad based market solutions, and yet we remain at the very early stages of what Optum can be.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now I'll turn to John Rex, CFO of UnitedHealth Group.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>John Rex </strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you, Andrew. Our first half positions us to perform well for the rest of the year. In the quarter, revenues grew 8% to $60.6 billion and net earnings from operations grew 13% to $4.7 billion. All of the business segments contributed strongly to these well balanced results. With previously discussed business transitions now effective as of mid-year, we're updating our full year revenue outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">With these incorporated, we expect 2019 revenue to be at or just slightly below the original $243 billion to $245 billion range. This reflects the transition of a large OptumRx client due to a business combination and are voluntary withdrawal from a state Medicaid program, partially offset by the DMG combination.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Cash flows from operations were $5.9 billion in the quarter and year-to-date are $9.1 billion or 1.3 times net income. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow from operations of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion or 1.2 to 1.3 times net income. Medical costs remain well managed with our 2019 medical care ratio tracking well to the range we shared with you back in November of 82.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Unit cost remains a core driver of overall trend, and we continue to advance our efforts to optimize both site of service and use of the highest performing clinicians. We continue to expect that 2019 will mark the 11th consecutive year of declining inpatient admissions per 1,000 people. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Our operating costs ratio of 13.9% is impacted by the deferral of the health insurer tax and a strong mix of productivity and operational improvement enterprise wide. And with our focus on affordability, that agenda is never really done. At the same time, we continue to aggressively expand the investments we are making in innovation to drive organic growth and further operational and productivity improvements over the decades to come.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In 2019, our effective tax rate is favorably impacted as expected by the deferral of the non-deductible health insurance tax. The second quarter rate was moderately higher than our original outlook. For the full year of 2019, we now expect the tax rate will likely be around 20.5%. That's the upper end of our original range for the year, which is fully incorporated in today's raised earnings outlook and is due impart to lower than expected employee stock-based compensation activity.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We continue to maintain balance sheet strength and significant flexibility. Return on equity in the second quarter again exceeded 25%. UnitedHealth Group has a long well developed and proven ability to thoughtfully deploy capital through business combinations that add capabilities and market presence to be leveraged across the enterprise, bringing both synergies and growth and costs.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">In June, our Board of Directors raised our shareholder dividend by 20% to an annual rate of $4.32 per share. The dividend has advanced at or above 20% each year since initiated about a decade ago, and at about a 30% payout ratio has grown to be more in line with the market level objective we set. Still our long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to continue to advance the dividend at strong rates for years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We remain confident as we look forward to the second half of 2019. And now expect adjusted earnings per share of $14.70 to $14.90, an increase of $0.25 from the guidance we established at the end of last year. Within that, as previously discussed, the pacing of weekdays is higher in the third quarter this year, resulting in a relatively consistent level of earnings between the third and fourth quarters. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">Delivering on our 2019 commitments and strengthening our business further as we approach 2020 remain critical to us. Even as we pursue ever greater impact for society and advanced growth and returns for our shareholders for years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, I'll turn it back to Dave. </p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>David Wichmann </strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you, John. We will continue investing for the future building, innovating and diversifying as we seek to support the development of the next generation health system, a system that provides high quality and efficient access for all, a system that achieves better outcomes and experiences at lower costs for people. This is the essential work of our enterprise. It provides us with an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to help improve healthcare in the U.S. and globally, and to continue growing our business in these large and fast growing markets.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">It is why if you spend time at our organization, you can feel the restlessness among our 320,000 dedicated professionals, all focused on making an impact in everything we do, and generating stronger societal and shareholder return.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And with that, let's open it up for questions. One question per caller, please, operator.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">[Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Justin Lake </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks. Good morning. First, just let me congratulate and wish John Penshorn on a great retirement, well deserved, you’ll be missed.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And then I've got a MLR question a couple parts. So bear with me. First, any color on quarterly medical trends, specifically, you saw very strong development in the quarter, any offsetting trend factors that we should think about? And then you're halfway through the year, can you give us an update on where you see MLR trending relative to the full year guidance of 82.5%? And lastly, you mentioned the days of the week, kind of impacting negatively to third quarter as they positively impact the Q1. So anything you could do to help us thinking about MLR in the third quarter relative to the 81% from last year. Thanks for bearing with me.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks. John Rex?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Sure, Justin, good morning. So a few things, just thinking about first of all on your first point here on impacts on quarterly trends. So underlying trend as they stayed very much in line with our expectations, so no change in that in terms of the trend factors we lay out we've talked about and I would say even really no change in the components within that trend.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I would say kind of in terms of other things going on in the quarter within that nothing in the cost line. I mean I would point out that in the revenue line there's probably one item I could speak to that would have impact on that. So there's probably about roughly $100 million maybe a little bit more than $100 million of unfavorable revenue adjustment in the commercial business that was booked in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So you recall there are risk adjustment factors that apply to commercial business for ACA compliant individual and small group products. And so that goes through over a long period of time, our data submissions have been and continue to be highly accurate on that. However, it's kind of a fixed pool in the end. And so there was a true up as there were auto adjustments on other plans, then what happens is that rolls through you get adjusted because of the fixed pool.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So that's one element that would have been rolling through in the quarter. And I'd size that in the tune of a kind of $100 million. So that doesn't show in reserves right that’s the revenue adjustment a negative revenue adjustment. So that's one element I point out.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">I think, in terms of kind of a combining your last two questions Justin, a little bit here. And so 3Q has that extra week day essentially a Monday, whereas -- and 1Q and that you can kind of see in the sequential progression even 1Q to 2Q, 1Q benefited from there being one less weekday than normal. So that does impact progression, whereas typically you would see 3Q is often than one of our higher earnings quarters and my comments, in my prepared comments I talked about kind of relatively stable EPS in between the two quarters. But you're right and thinking about that within the 3Q you should expect that MCR is impacted most like we got the benefit in the 1Q. Does that get at your questions, Justin. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Justin Lake </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Just the MLR for the year the 82.5% and now that we're halfway through the year any anywhere you want us to kind of think about. You feel like you're on track with midpoint or slightly higher or slightly lower.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">We think we're tracking well on MLR for the year in that range. So -- and well kind of in that zone so nothing notable on that.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Justin Lake</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Great, thank you very much. </p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Justin. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about sort of the commercial membership here, I think at the Analysts Day you guys talked about sort of to see improving membership growth there. The quarter was relatively flat. Can you give us a sense on how we should be thinking about that as we think to the first year given some your comments today?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Sure. Dirk do you want to address that?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Dirk McMahon</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yes. Let me start off in the fully insured area. We improved over the first quarter. We had nominal fully insured losses in 2Q. There's no notable areas to mention. We're confident that we price our book consistent with our trend forecast. And we actually see how our pricing approach actually pulled through to the earnings. So that's kind of the fully insured story.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">As it relates to fee, we lost 80,000 members in the second quarter, but that's normal related to national account seasonal attrition. As we look at our fee business, throughout 2019, what we expect to see is that favorable membership growth above and beyond the acquisition that we made. So that's kind of the commercial membership story.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you, Charles. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Raskin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll echo the congratulations to Mr. John Penshorn as well for all his help over the years. I'm curious about the John Muir announcement. I know you guys mentioned it. I'm curious, what makes it unique? Is it just the breadth of services? Or is it -- it sounds like a lot of things that you guys have been in the market doing. And then can you talk maybe a little bit more broadly about preparing large systems to take risk and why Optum thinks it's a good idea for these large systems to be taking more and more risk, even maybe starting with their own health plan.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And I guess last part of this, we're seeing a lot of the demand -- we're seeing a lot of the supply in the market from enablers of that type of technology and systems that are doing what Optum is doing. Is there demand that sort of matches that supply? I know it's kind of a lot of questions in there, but just sort of broadly on that topic.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">So maybe Eric can answer the specific question on John Muir and then we'll have Andrew Witty, take the second part there around preparing large systems. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Eric Murphy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, maybe I'll do first and second, if that's okay there, or first and third, sorry. Josh, thanks for the question Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. Our partnership with John Muir Health really represents one of the most comprehensive in the healthcare industry, between a delivery system and a health care services company. The integrated scope of services includes acute and ambulatory revenue cycle management end-to-end information technology services, ambulatory care coordination, enterprise analytics, purchasing and consulting services.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">It is very unique in the marketplace in that health system has never contemplated putting out that much of a scope of work on both the back office as well as what I'd call the middle office of a delivery system. So it is quite unique and first in the industry, and Optum is ideally suited to be able to address those expansive needs of John Muir Health. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">In terms of the third part of your question, our market knowledge suggests that several hundred regional health systems have similar size and market opportunity as John Muir. We’re already in discussions with several high performing independent community based systems and look forward to establishing continued partnerships, similar to John Muir Health, with health systems across the industry.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Andrew, do you want to take the second part?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Andrew Witty</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. Thanks, Eric. And thanks, Josh, for the question. I mean, clearly, we have a very strong view that the best way forward in terms of improving quality bringing down total cost of care is to increasingly new towards value in terms of the management of the care continuum. That is very much the focus of the OptumCare strategy and is resonant throughout all of our various platforms. But it's also very clear that we're seeing more and more systems begin to look to move in that direction.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">Where as they look to Optum, they can see portfolios of information systems, skills, which have been developed within our own organization, which are going to be just as useful within those systems as they are within for example, our OptumCare organization. So for us, this is a very important opening up of a new front in terms of the opportunity to develop our interventions in the marketplace, and we believe move to a more sustainable high quality, lower cost healthcare environment.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Josh Raskin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you, Josh. Next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">We’ll go next to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. </p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Matthew Borsch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes, I was hoping maybe you could comment on the -- how you're looking at the -- if you're continuing with the same PBM rebate strategy that you focused on. And did that looks any different now that the administration has decided to withdraw from the ban in rebates in Medicare.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Good question, Matt. Our decisions around rebates and the application of them where pharmacy pricing protection doesn't exist and an existing policy was made independent of any pending regulation and it was done so well over a year ago now, or so. So our commitment to that remains, I think you know that there's, of the policies that exists particularly in the commercial market about 75% of them already have pharmacy price protection mechanisms in them like a copay, whereas the other 25%, and I'm generalizing here, but the other 25% don't.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And when that is the case, in particular, when it intersects with some of the legacy high deductible health plans there, it was really compelling for us to drive rebates to the point of sale to create greater affordability for consumers. We just felt that that was the right consumer response. </p>, <p class=""p p9"">So that won't change, as we think about moving forward, there are some legislation on HDHP yesterday, which I thought was pretty forward leaning, which allows for greater flexibilities around managing high deductible health plans that would give us greater flexibility as a market leader in that segment to be able to modify those policies and offer a greater range that allows us to be able to deal with the breadth of issues that arise with those policies intersecting with individuals with chronic disease.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So we're looking forward also to bringing out new policies that are more responsive broadly to consumer expectations. So you can expect us not to change our stance on rebates.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Matthew Borsch</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question is from David Windley with Jeffries. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Windley</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi, thanks. Maybe combining a couple of questions. Dave, to your last answer, on this rebate policy and thinking about membership -- commercial membership, I believe the company has said that it is requiring any new customers to go to a point of sale rebate regime is that having a positive or negative affecting in your selling in commercial?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So there's two elements to this, first was the 8 million to 9 million or so people that are covered with or have a point of sale rebates applied in our fully insured markets, that is pretty close to being done. That was commenced effective January 1, 2019 on renewal date. So we still have some renewals that will take place as a result of that. The impact of that has been $130 per eligible script savings and as much as a 16% improvement in adherence. So we're going to monitor that and really evaluate what the long-term implications are on individual health and the overall use of healthcare resources.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">The second piece, again, relates to those opportunities that come to us from January 1, 2020 and beyond, that have no pharmacy price protection mechanism in the plan design, which again, would be about 25% of the total plan design. In those situations, we would only take on that case in the -- if we were able to apply rebates at the point of sale, I'm speaking for UnitedHealthcare at this stage. So those are the -- that's the plan for us going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">In terms of implication, so, there has been no implication with respect to the -- that policy adoption. The one thing we did see pretty quickly thereafter is a lot more interest on the part of large employers and possibly applying the same policy recognizing that consumers are at risk if they have a high cost drugs and policy features that don't protect them from inflation on those drugs.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Windley</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you, David. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Next question is from a Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Kevin Fischbeck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great, thanks. Just want to get a bit more color on the guidance raise. You raised, the quarter I guess by more than you beat consensus, consensus isn’t always where I guess the company is thinking the numbers are going to be for the quarter. But how much of the guidance raise reflects kind of just the upside that you report in a quarter versus kind of flowing through that upside into out quarters, versus some of the deals that you've closed since last quarter. If you could break into the three components, that would be great. </p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">The raise reflect the overall confidence we have in the performance of the business, as we sit here today and our prospects for growth. But also, as we look forward to the future as well, but John, can you adjust to the details?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure, Kevin. So I'd say and the last part of your comment, in terms of any transactions closed immaterial, really, in terms of in terms of what we're doing here today. So those will be, just not that impactful in 2019 to even be noticeable. So really, not about that. I think we tried to show you kind of an impact in terms of the investment income line, in terms of the venture gain that we recognized in the quarter to help level set somewhat on that, in terms of the impact that it had in the in the quarter itself.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">I think the other component, I would just say that I mentioned in my prepared comments, at least, compared to our outlook, also the tax rate came in about a bit higher for us in the quarter. So providing some offset on that. And then I think in response to Justin's question, I pointed out kind of another impact that was yet another offset on that.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">So a lot of those factors kind of, as I go through that you can see within the quarter, pretty much washing out in terms of that impact. Does that help, Kevin?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Kevin Fischbeck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, I think that helps. I guess you're saying though, that when you break it out, it's been mostly within the quarter or is it the split between the quarter and rest of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">I’ll be clear on that. So what I was saying is, in terms of when you look at kind of the impact in the quarter and kind of that go. So what I called out was that we talked about the venture gain, we talked about some other elements that go -- that offset that. So really that drags in, in terms of kind of how we're feeling about our full year and kind of the optimism confidence we have in the full year. Because some of those quarterly elements really wash out.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Kevin Fischbeck</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Perfect, thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you, Kevin. Next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Ricky Goldwasser </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, good morning. So my questions are around kind of like what we're hearing out of DC. Obviously, the rebate rule is out, but we have some -- couple of new proposals wanted to get your view on them. So the first one, the administration put out recently an executive order that looked at increasing price transparency in healthcare, including requiring providers and insurance to provide or facilitate some access to information about negotiate rates. So I wanted to see kind of like how you think about this, and the potential impact on the competitive dynamics?</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And secondly, back in May, House Ways [ph] and means kind of like an unveiled its legislation that it would shift to risk of catastrophic coverage, and look at a donut hole from patients and the government to health plans and manufacturers. How do you think about this? Is this yet just another proposal that would ultimately result in higher premium and therefore would be shelved? Or what potential impact do you think it could have on you? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">There's a lot of policies and proposals and proposed regulation activity going on today. And it's in part mixed with the political campaigns. So there's a lot to -- there's a lot out there. And some of that is subjected to formal processes and others is more just direct commentary. And so our -- I think here for this purpose, we would probably restrict our commentary to general types of themes as opposed to find ourselves commenting outside of the formal process.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But -- so I just maybe emphasize a few things here. One is, as it relates to drug prices in particular, I think it's fairly clear now that there's that drug companies set these prices. I think one of the things that was implied in a rebate rule was important emphasis on continuing the PBM’s rule as a counterbalance against those list prices increases, but also direct recognition of the strong value PBMs bring not only in the management of procurement, but also as they manage the pharmacy benefit, as well as in the case of OptumRx distinct value that comes with the intersection of all of that with the medical benefit, driving considerable additional value.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We save consumers about $2,000 per year, per consumer in these activities. And I think that folks are starting to realize that and really value it. So I think that that will weigh heavily on whatever ultimately comes out. Also, I think you've also seen that we began bringing really strong value to people through this application of rebates at the point of sale. Really to ensure that consumers are protected from these list price increases overall to the best of our abilities and we'll continue to pursue those activities.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And so I think that covers off your -- the kind of the commentary you had about the rebate rule. And the second piece as it relates to the House Ways and means donor hole. Do we have any specific commentary on -- further commentary on that looks like not. So we'll just stick with that response for now. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you, Ricky. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">We'll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tanal </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks a lot guys. You’ve covered a lot of ground, I guess, the one thing on the guidance that you didn't touch is the OCR ratio 14.4% to 15%, I think was the last guy, it seems like it's tracking a little light there. So that's really just my question any color there? And maybe just if I could sneak one more. On the PPD, we would love to know what was entry year verse prior year inside of the 270? Thanks so much.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">John?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Hi, Steve. Yes, no change on our OCR outlook for the year. Though as you kind of if you look at the year-over-year. I'm sure you're well aware the primary change in the OCR is driven by the health insurance tax that gets being offset by strong efficiency and productivity gains. And then of course, we continue to make significant ongoing strategic investments in our businesses. So -- but no change from the outlook, we still expect to be in the guidance range of 14.7% plus or minus 30 basis points for the year.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tanal </span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And the PPD side. </p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">A.J. Rice</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask about MA now the bids are in for 2020. I know the company stressed the last few years’ consistency of benefits. We'll get the health insurance be coming back next year. Do you feel like, you'll be able to maintain, at least in a broad sense, consistency of benefits next year and it looks like two of your major competitors in the space that have grown extraordinarily this year have done so via really deploying those benefits of the hip moratorium this year. And presumably they may have to look at that next year. Do you see an opportunity maybe for a little bit of accelerated growth, if you can be consistent next year?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good question, A.J.. I really applaud our team's efforts and how they thought through this on a multi-year basis. Brian, you want to give him some details?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brian Thompson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Sure. Thanks for the question, A.J. To your point, obviously the tax is returning in 2020. As I’ve said before, we will measured and discipline and how we went to market inside 2019. Certainly mindful of that tax headwind returning. I would say our multi-year approach was a critical factor in shaping our optimism around 2020. Our goal and intention is to keep our benefits largely stable to improving despite these headwinds. So, right now, I would say that we're really pleased with our product positioning going into next year and a foundational element was our discipline in 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you, A.J. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Peter Costa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Good morning, and good luck to John Penshorn and congrats to Brad or maybe that should be the other way around. My questions is on DMG, I want to talk about -- the performance of that has been fairly weak over the last few years. And now that you've got it the transaction closed and it's yours. How will you improve the performance of that business? And how quickly do you think you can bring some improved earnings to the bottom-line there?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you, Peter, for the question. We're pleased to close the transaction out your extraordinarily long time. Dr. Wyatt Decker is here. Wyatt, do you want to talk about what you're doing at DMG?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Wyatt Decker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Peter for the question. At OptumHealth, our care platform we call OptumCare is building the nation's leading value-based physician led and patient focused health care system. We're very pleased to have completed the acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which combines another leading medical center with our practice.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We feel confident that as we provide our clinical expertise, analytics and services to the DaVita Medical practices, you will see enhanced performance of the DaVita Medical Group and integration with our leading value based practices. Thank you. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">So Peter, we are pretty pleased with how DaVita transitioned over. Having done -- bring down diligence and looking at the run rate or the performance of the business. So we were pretty pleased with that. And so the foundation from which we will improve that practice and drive the type of synergies that we expect was there. And so we have high confidence you'll start to see some meaningful contributions from that platform in 2020 and beyond.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks for the question, Peter. Next question, please. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Sarah James</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. It's clear the value United and insurers are creating for healthcare affordability and quality when you look at the historical industry cost trend of 7% to 8% being brought down to 6% range with consumerism. And now you have a peer talking about future trends in below 2% range benchmark to medical CPI granted they have some skewing from ASL inclusion. And Dave at a conference last month, you mentioned national health expenditures plus or minus is interesting construct to consider medical costs trend. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">So I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on how you think about the right framework for talking about cost trend, whether it's CPI or NHE and if it is national health expenditures, which runs in the mid-5, how do you think about United’s business model being able to produce long-term trend in line or better than national health expenditure trend?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">That's a really thoughtful question, Sarah. So a couple of things. First, we have begun to look at it more closely and thinking about whether how we are contributing to bringing a greater affordability more broadly across the segment of Medicare, Medicaid in commercial. And have started to evaluate that against NHE to determine again, whether we are a contributor to trend or whether we are actually reducing trend.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And so that that's something that I think you'll hear more about from us. The other is as we sit here, we oftentimes talk in commercial trend context in these settings. All the while, we have a very robust and large government programs based business. And those obviously have trends inside them as well. So we're trying to think about a way to bring forward a view of that more broadly. So you can assess our aggregate performance across our business.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">We -- so NHE will be important in that respect. It is a complicated metric in many respects, I can -- I think I can safely say that we are contributing positively to reducing the nation's healthcare burden. And that healthcare burden has been declining over the course of the more recent past. And we would aim very hard to continue to move that forward, recognizing that the way to get that done is to advanced quality first and foremost, which is really the improving outcomes. And then the evaluation of and making sure that we drive efficiency in the use of the nation's healthcare resources in achieving that quality, and then not missing the opportunity to improve the patient experience as well.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So this is a very high priority for this organization to contribute in a constructive way to reducing the overall healthcare burden in the U.S. And we believe you can see that in some of the remarks that, informing the health system through the application of the IHR, engaging people and managing their health conditions more proactively through the Raleigh platform and aligning the reward system in healthcare to drive that triple A value is essential to achieving that. And that's the essence of the commentary that I began this call with today.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We would add a fourth element to that and that was really around our physicians and providing them a work environment or environment where they can practice medicine, the way they've been trained and to allow them to the freedoms without burnout to be able to deliver solid, high quality outcomes and results for their patient base. And we believe that OptumCare is and UnitedHealthcare broadly is creating just that environment.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you for the question, Sarah. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Lance Wilkes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, just had a question with respect to the drivers of growth over in the Optum side of the business. I was wondering for Optum Health, for its growth, how much of that growth was driven from risk taking or the shift to value based reimbursement and however on the PBM side how much was driven by increased use of specialty home delivery?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Tom Roos, do you want to take that? </p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Tom Roos</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Sure. Thanks very much, Lance. Appreciate the question. So when we look at the growth at Optum broadly, very significant growth and really good market acceptance around the risk taking that we have in OptumCare, and continue to expect to see growth there. As well in other parts of OptumHealth, very much seeing growth in the Optum serve part of the business, which is the part of the business that serves the federal employees as well as military veterans’ part of our business. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">And you may recall earlier in the year we announced at the end of last year, we had received a new contract for a community care network. And with that, we were awarded three regions. And when we were awarded that we expected that we would have about 6 million potential new members in there over the next several years and we've driven very well at the implementation of regions one, and two. And just continuing to drive success in that market. And then the other area that I would focus on is Optum financial services as well. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">One of the leading health services, financial institutions with about 5.5 million consumer accounts and very significant growth in assets under management as well. And just continuing to really drive growth in that part of the market to really help with tools and capabilities for consumers to be able to drive decision making that they use to access care and to be able to fund and serve those individuals as they're making decisions around care choices, and affordability.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So really good solid growth in that area, as well, I would say in the PBM the really strong acceptance of pharmacy care services models, you see the wins that both Dave and Andrew talked about in script and in their prepared comments, just really solid growth in that area. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then also on OptumInsight, strong acceptance in terms of market approach on large deals like the recent announcement of John Muir Health and the strength of bringing healthcare technology services into that part of the market to be able to help with moving the risk and also being able to be more effective in delivering care to consumers and individuals. </p>, <p class=""p p13"">So I would look at the full spectrum and say really good, solid opportunities to drive good organic growth that we've been seeing across all of Optum.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Good question, Lance. Hopefully you read in all that that even we oftentimes showcase certain elements in the call here, but there's a very strong underlying and diverse base of businesses inside Optum that are advancing value to consumers on and the health system broadly on multiple different dimensions.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">We are running short of time. So I think we can take two more questions. And then we'll conclude the call. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And we'll go to Michael Newshel with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. </p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Newshel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks. Going back to the history, is there any talent with embedded into the 2019 guidance now for midyear commercial intervals that they can return to the fee for the 2020 months of similar to what you saw in 2017?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">So yes, so just -- thanks for your question there. So not meaningful in terms of any kind of impact there. But every year so we're getting a little familiar with things like this that come in and out of the outlook here. So kind of individually discrete factors that may influence the annual growth rate, I wouldn't call it meaningful in terms of any kind of impact on that for 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">But yes, this thing will come back again in 2020, comes in, in and out, it seems to insert some in year impact. While given the diversity of our business space, it's usually, really not all that material for us. We look at it as kind of a -- an element that should be addressed here ultimately as you reintroduce that to the system. But nothing material that I call out in the 2019 outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Newshel</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">All right. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">David Wichmann</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. Next question, please.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Ralph Giacobbe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks. Good morning. I'm surprised that no one has asked about this. Any initial commentary on sort of 2020 and specifically if you can size the hist [ph] and headwinds, in terms of just size dollars there. And whether or not that'll hinder your ability to grow within your 13% to 16% target range at this point? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">John Rex</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Sure. Well, no, I guess, I'll start by saying I appreciate the valiant attempt to 2020 guidance, which we won't be providing here today. And keeping that long held custom we will provide some initial thoughts in October with our third quarter earnings call and then we'll provide really detailed view at our investor conferences as we always do. I will offer a few thoughts, because I think you asked a good thoughtful question there.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So first as it relates to our 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth objective is just that, but long-term outlook not meant to be a single quarter or a single year point estimate. I think as I reflect back a little bit, let’s say over the last decade or so, let's see. So we've through today reported 42 quarters, right. I'd say annual average growth rate over that period has been 18%, but including where I expect to land in 2019, we had seven quarters that have all been well above or within that 13% to 16% target and four that were below. </p>, <p class=""p p14"">If I call a little more granularity, I think about 42 quarters, we've had 28 that were in or above that guidance range and 14 were below. So it's a pretty strong batting average against the long-term growth rate. And we expect it's going to continue to be quite strong for the decade to come. But it's a long-term growth rate, and we manage the business to sustain that growth in the future. We don't -- typically there aren't in discrete individual factors that we see as that have really influenced that and I can think about many factors that have occurred over the course of this company, whether it was going back to stars or other elements or years where Medicare rates were not -- where we're different than maybe expected.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">The hit is just the favor that comes in and out and openly passes through also. I think a few things that, I know you're all well aware of here though, it is a cost that's ultimately shouldered by American families, small businesses and seniors. It's a non-deductable task to comes in and you've seen it come in and out. And I know you all are deeply aware of the mechanics and for us, it’s just mechanics passes through. But it comes in and out and cut insert year, end year impact sometimes when it comes in and out.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">As I said in the last -- response to last question, given the diversity of our business, it's just not really all that material to us. But it's noticeable that, things like I'd point out that, again, you're well aware of non-deductible nature of the tax alone adds 300 to 400 basis points to our effective tax rate. That's just the math of it. There's the calendar year versus policy year differentials on the commercial business, I can go on. But I'm confident that after several years of this, by now you're all aware of those impacts.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>David Wichmann</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Right. Thank you, John. Thank you all. So I’d just like to maybe sum up where we are, as we close out this call. UnitedHealth Group ended the first half of 2019 with considerable momentum delivering strong, well balanced earnings growth across all of our businesses. It's with confidence that we're expanding -- with our expanding capabilities and available growth opportunities that we increased our outlook for full year adjusted earnings per share.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">Optum and UnitedHealthcare both perform strongly in the quarter. Both are focused on lowering costs and improving health outcomes and the consumer experience as they seek to help advance the next generation health system in a socially conscious way. A system that provides high quality, efficient and fair access for all. This concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">And this will conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.</p>]"

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investors Relations.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there’s a presentation available for download from UTC’s website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will seek to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring cost and other significant items of non-recurring and/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">UTC’s SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. In addition, in connection with the merger to be discussed today, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement which will include a prospectus of UTC and joint proxy statement of UTC Raytheon that will contain important information about UTC Raytheon the merger and related matter. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Greg Hayes</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Okay. Thank you, Sonia, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from the press release, Q2 another strong quarter for UTC. As you can see we reported adjusted EPS of $2.20 and that’s up 12% versus last year and a continuation of the strong performance we saw in the first quarter of this year. Sales were up 18% with 6% of that organic, driven by contributions from all four of the businesses. And I think importantly, free cash flow is really solid at $1.6 billion in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Just a couple of highlights. Pratt &amp; Whitney, they booked nearly 1,000 GTF firm and option orders at the Paris Air Show. And the Pratt team continues to execute on the GTF cost reduction initiatives and importantly are meeting the customer delivery requirements. At Otis, nice to see that they’re on track, 50 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter and a continued focus on the service transformation initiatives that are starting to pay off in the business.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">So based on the strong first half of 2019, we are going to raise both the top and bottom end of our adjusted EPS outlook. So we now expect earnings this year between $7.90 and $8.05. That's up from our previous expectation of $7.80 to $8. We are also going to raise the low-end of our organic sales outlook. So we now expect 4% to 5% of organic sales growth, that's up from our last look at 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow somewhere between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. But keep in mind, that includes a $1.5 billion placeholder for the one-time portfolio separation costs. We will talk more about that later.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Beyond the quarter, maybe just a few comments. I know there are some things that people are wondering about, so let me just go through the other big things that are going on starting with the integration of Rockwell Collins. Q2, again a great quarter for Rockwell. Acquisition -- post-acquisition the business continues to exceed our expectations. We saw like $0.15 of accretion in the quarter. And for the full-year, we now expect about $0.50 of accretion from the Rockwell Collins deal. That’s up from $0.35 at the start of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As we also highlighted last month, we now expect to see about $600 million of cost synergies related to Rockwell by year four. That’s up a $100 million from our original guidance. And as you know, Kelly Ortberg, as he discussed in Paris, the team has identified more than a 100 projects, which are expected to drive over $1 billion of revenue synergy opportunities. So really a great start to the year for Rockwell, a great start for Kelly Ortberg and the whole team at Collins Aerospace and we see great things in the future.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Maybe just a minute on the spin transactions. They’re on track as we have noted before to be completed in the first half of 2020. And as you know, we are targeting completion at the first half or the end of first quarter of next year subject to the timing of the tax rulings in a couple of jurisdictions. As you saw in early June, we name the CEOs for both Carrier and Otis and we're making good progress on the Board formation for both companies. So everything continues to be on track with all of the portfolio separation activities.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We got about 600 people working. We got about 13,000 tasks yet to complete, but we will get this done and we are confident by the early part of next year, we will be ready to go with the spins. Finally, I mean, just a word on Raytheon. As I said in Paris, the combination of Raytheon and United Technologies Aerospace largely completes our strategy to become the leading platform agnostic provider of high tech systems to the aerospace and defense industry. We are really confident that this proposed merger capitalizes on the unique opportunity to create significant long-term value for our share owners, for our customers and employees, and we believe that we will redefine the A&amp;D industry for decades to come.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the near-term, we can also expect to see over $1 billion of gross cost synergies by year four and allow for accelerated capital returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As we said last month, you can expect $18 billion to $20 billion return to shareholders in the first three years post-close. The transaction we expect will be immediately accretive to UTC earnings and we expect to see $0.20 to $0.30 of EPS accretion on an adjusted basis in the first full-year following the close. To see a few exhibits in the appendix that highlight some of the key attributes of the deal.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">So with that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you through the results. And I’ll be back at the end for wrap up, and then we will take your questions. Akhil?</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Akhil Johri</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thanks, Greg. So I’m on Slide 2. For Q2, reported sales of $19.6 billion were up 18%, including 6% organic growth, 13 points of M&amp;A benefit, largely Rockwell Collins acquisition. Foreign exchange was up 1 point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.20, was up $0.23 or 12% versus the prior year. Coincidently on a GAAP basis, EPS was also $2.20, down 14% versus prior year and included $0.06 of restructuring charges offset by $0.06 of net nonrecurring gains.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The nonrecurring items included $0.37 of gains associated with finalization of some tax audit. The good news is Legacy UTC is now current with the IRS through 2016. This was partially offset by $0.28 of charges related to the UTC portfolio separation activities and $0.03 of net other charges. Now just as a reminder, last year second quarter included a $0.74 gain associated with the sale of the Taylor business, which is we are down year-over-year on a GAAP basis. Free cash flow for the first half was $2.8 billion, up more than 50% or approximately $900 million compared to the first half of 2018. That puts us exactly in line with our expectations and on track to deliver on our full-year outlook as Greg noted.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">So on Slide 3, you see the drivers of our organic growth. Looking at the commercial businesses in the Americas, sales were up 4%. Nonresidential construction indicators remain positive. However, housing starts are now expected to be down low single digits in 2019 versus the low single-digit growth we expected coming into the year. We’ve also seen a slower start to the summer with cooling degree days in weather sensitive states down 18% through Q2 compared to 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Within EMEA, sales were down 3% in the quarter. In Europe, excluding Middle East, Carrier was down mid-single digits, while Otis was up slightly. The economic outlook across Europe remains mixed and overall is weaker than the expectations coming into the year. In the Middle East, activity levels remain very low for both Carrier and Otis. In Asia, sales were up 8%. China sales were up 10%, including mid-teens growth at Otis. We continue to see modest price increases and favorable mix in Otis new equipment orders in China.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">On the Aerospace side, commercial OEM sales were up 8% driven by Pratt &amp; Whitney, which was up more than 20%. At Collins Aerospace, Commercial OEM sales were up only slightly on an organic basis as higher sales and content on new platforms like Boeing 787 Airbus 350,320neo and 220 were largely offset by lower negative platform related sales.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For Commercial Aftermarket, sales were also up 8%. We continue to see high traffic demand and strong utilization. Commercial Aftermarket sales at Pratt &amp; Whitney were up 2%. At Collins Aerospace, Commercial Aftermarket sales were up 18% organically. Provisioning for the Legacy UTAS business was up over 30%, driven by MRO stocking activity, which is not likely to continue at these levels in the second half.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">For the year, Collins now expects organic provisioning sales to be up low-teens due to the strength we saw in the first half. Organically military sales were up 15% at Pratt &amp; Whitney and 9% at Collins Aerospace, primarily driven by the ramping JSF production.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now before I hand over to Carroll, just a few comments on our improved 2019 outlook and the moving pieces. At the operating segment level, a reduced outlook at Carrier is more than offset by the strength at Collins Aerospace. We’ve included a chart in the appendix on Slide 12 with updated sales and profit walks for both businesses as a reference.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">At Carrier, while market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in the U.S., we are not seeing growth at the levels we expected coming into the year. Soft order rates in the first half, particularly in the refrigeration and global HVAC end markets have led us to reduce the full-year top line growth expectations by $350 million to $400 million. This translates to around $100 million of earnings headwind, which is what you see dropping out of Carrier's operating profit outlook. So while Carrier is still expected to grow the top and bottom line, the growth will be less than what we expected coming into the year.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Dave Gitlin and the Carrier team continue to drive cost reduction and other productivity initiatives to offset under absorption and other impacts related to volume aim shortfalls in 2019. More importantly, Dave is reinvigorating operational excellence initiatives at Carrier, which will strengthen the business for long-term success as an independent company.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">On the positive side, we see $150 million improvement in the full-year operating profit outlook for Collins Aerospace. This is driven in equal parts by higher cost synergies, better legacy Rockwell Collins performance, primarily in the avionics business, and the strong aftermarket results we saw at the Legacy UTAS business in the first half. No significant changes below the line. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rates to be between 23% and 24% in 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Bottom line, we feel very good about our improved organic sales and adjusted EPS range for 2019, and for those who are keeping score at the midpoint of our improved adjusted EPS range, we still have approximately $60 million of contingency.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">With that, let me turn it over to Carroll to take us through the business unit details. Carroll?</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Carroll Lane</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on Slide 4. Now I'll be speaking of the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there’s an Appendix on Slide 15 with additional segment data you can use as a reference.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Otis. Otis sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, up 4% organically. On a constant currency basis, new equipment sales grew 4%, mid-teens growth in China and low single-digit growth in the Americas were partially offset by mid single-digit declines in EMEA and low single-digit declines in Asia, excluding China.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Service sales were up 5% with growth in all regions driven by mid single-digit growth in maintenance and repair as well as modernization. New equipment orders declined 6% in the quarter and are down 1% on a 12 months rolling basis. Orders in North America were down high-teens, driven in part of the timing of major orders.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now despite soft orders in the first half, backlog in North America is up low single-digits this year versus the prior year. And the overall activity level in North America including project awards remains stable. Asia orders, excluding China were down mid-teens on tough compares, while Europe was up slightly. China orders were up 5% as the fifth consecutive quarter of value growth with orders benefiting from favorable pricing and mix.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Operating profit was up 9% at constant currency, driven by strong volume growth in both new equipment and service. This marks the third consecutive quarter for operational profit growth at Otis, largely driven by continued improvement in the profitability of the service business. Foreign exchange translation was a 4 point headwind to sales and a 5 point headwind to earnings. So given slightly better-than-expected first-half performance, we remain confident in Otis's full-year operating profit growth of $25 million to $75 million at constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to Slide 5, Carrier sales were up 2% organically. Global HVAC was up 3% with North America residential up 2% and Commercial HVAC up 4%. Refrigeration and Fire and Security were both up 1%.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Carrier equipment orders contracted 12% organically in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders were down 63% on tough compares in North America truck trailer. You'll recall that orders were up more than 100% in Q2 of 2018. In Europe, truck trailer orders were down more than 25%, commercial refrigeration orders were down 11% in the quarter, as European markets have softened.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Commercial HVAC orders were down 4% with EMEA down 10%, reflecting the market dynamics that Akhil noted earlier. North America residential orders were down 3%, also on tough compares. For the first half, North America residential orders were up 1% including the impact of the cooler than expected start to the summer.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">At constant currency, operating profit grew 2%, excluding a 1 point impact from the divestiture of Taylor. Earnings growth from higher volume and pricing more than offset commodity and tariff increases as well as investments and productivity initiatives.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">So looking ahead, we expect carrier earnings growth in the second half of the year driven by cost reduction actions, productivity initiatives and easier compares on commodities, tariffs, logistics expenses and foreign exchange. However, given the revised outlook for Carrier's end markets, we are lowering Carrier's outlook for the full-year. We now see low single-digit organic sales growth and earnings growth in the range of $25 million to $75 million at constant currency.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. Shifting to Pratt &amp; Whitney on Slide 6. Sales of $5.2 billion were up 9% on an organic and reported basis. Commercial OEM sales were up 22% on higher Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada engine shipments and the favorable mix of large commercial engine sales.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Commercial aftermarket was up 2%. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada aftermarket saw growth from higher content and favorable mix. This is partially offset by unfavorable contract re-estimates related to PW4000 engines. V2500 overhaul inductions in Q2 were up 5% versus Q2 of 2018 and up 20% sequentially from Q1 as capacity in the overall MRO network increased. That follows the temporary induction delays that we discussed in the first quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Military sales were up 15%, driven by the continued ramp of the F135 program. Adjusted operating profit of $427 million was up 7%. Favorable large commercial engine sales mix and continued GTF cost reduction more than offset the impact of the PW4000 contract re-estimates and higher E&amp;D. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pratt &amp; Whitney to grow full-year operating profit by $200 million to $250 million.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Turning to Collins Aerospace systems on Slide 7. Sales in the quarter were $6.6 billion, that's up $2.6 billion and operating profit of $1.2 billion, was up $538 million. On a pro forma basis including results for Rockwell Collins in the second quarter of 2018, Collins Aerospace delivered strong operating profit growth of 21% on 8% higher sales. The pro forma sales growth reflects strength across the combined Collins Aerospace business.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Commercial OEM sales were up mid-single digits and commercial aftermarket sales were up 16% with double-digit growth across all sales channels. Passenger traffic and demand for modifications and upgrades including avionics sales related to the ADS-B mandate remained strong and we saw another quarter of above trend provisioning sales.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Military sales were up mid-single digits driven by higher F35 volume and an overall strong order book. Operating profit growth was driven by the contribution from the Rockwell Collins business, drop through on higher organic sales and synergy benefits. This growth was partially offset by mix headwind and higher E&amp;D spend.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As a result of continued strength in sales volume and aggressive cost synergy capture, accretion from the Rockwell Collins acquisition to UTC earnings was approximately $0.15 in the quarter. Given the strong first half of the year, we now expects Collins Aerospace operating profit to be up $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion for the full-year with the Rockwell Collins acquisition delivering $0.50 of accretion to UTC earnings.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">And with that, I will hand it back over to Greg.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Greg Hayes</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Okay. Thanks, Carroll. Maybe just to note here, the second quarter results really above our expectations, but really a testament to the teamwork across UTC. These results don't just happens. Truly, the efforts of all of our employees, from the leadership of Bob and Kelly and Judy and Dave and the corporate folks right down to the folks on the shop floor, people that are building air-conditioners, servicing elevators, assembling the engines in Aerospace systems. It's a great team. This is a team that gives us confidence in our full-year improved adjusted outlook for 2019. And there is more good things to come.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">On the macroeconomic side, obviously the outlook varies region to region. Each business is expected to grow both top and bottom lines in 2019. And as Akhil noted, some of Carrier's end markets have not grown at the rates we expected going into the year. However, we are confident, Dave Gitlin and team are taking the actions to deliver on Carrier's revised outlook.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Dave Gitlin, as you know, has a strong background in optimizing operations. We’ve high confidence in his leadership as well as the rest of the Carrier team. Across all of UTC, we remain laser focused in our key priorities which are unchanged. That's execution, innovation, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. And I remain confident both the near and long-term prospects for each business and we are excited about the future as we transform the portfolio over the coming year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, Sonia, why don’t we go ahead and open it up for questions.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you and good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning, Sheila.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Greg, as part of the proxy you provided some long-term forecast for Pratt, specifically in 2023 EBIT margins for the large commercial business are expected to generate 7% margins. I guess, how does this compare to today and how should we think about the moving pieces with the GTF ramp and production or mix at aftermarket? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">So, Sheila, good question, good point. The number you caught is the large commercial engine business are not Pratt overall. That also has the impact as we have talked about, the decline from the Legacy aftermarket businesses that has a negative impact and that's a highly profitable business as you know today. So as the PW4000 fleet start to go down as the V2500 will remain stable, but some of the other PW2000 and PW4000 fleets go down, that aftermarket will come down and that's come with a high margin. On the other hand, the GTF aftermarket would not have started kicking in to a great level at that point which is why you see the suppressed margins. We expect full-year as you fast forward that and go into the late 2020s or the 2030s, you will see the LCE business, large commercial engine business profitability improved significantly.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. And so is it fair to say it's a low single-digit margin business at the moment, large -- Pratt large commercial engines?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Today, yes, based on all the investments that had been made and the negative engine margin in the GTFs, which is all in that business.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. You think about that, you were spending over a $1.2 billion in negative engine margin plus nearly a $1 billion in R&amp;D still across the commercial business. So it's a -- it is definitely a low single margin business, but as Akhil said, once the aftermarket kicks in 24, 25, that’s when the margins really tick up.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hey, guys. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Good morning, Steve.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Can you just talk about now what you expect for kind of the market for resi HVAC, I mean low single-digit revenue is not bad orders there it can turn pretty quickly. So do you see anything in July that makes you a little more positive on that front and what you now expect for kind of the total market to be in 2019 for resi?</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Yes. So obviously I think the early part of the summary has not been great, but the heat last couple of weeks it should help the moment of the residential business in the U.S. as you know, we are a two-step distribution, right? So our data is the shipment to our distributors, then the distributors have to sell it out to the consumers. We expect the market -- the replacement market still to be good with these late summer coming in, hopefully that helps with that. But overall market may be flat to slightly down now. We were expecting it to be up sort of mid-single-digit, low to mid single-digit when we came in with the us, with Carrier growing at a slightly faster rate than that. We still expect that trend to continue that Carrier growth will be a little faster than the market, but the market probably flat to down.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Got it. And then in Otis, just as a follow-up, you said timing of orders in North America there has been a few project delays driven by tariffs and labor inflection perhaps. Is that kind of what you are referring to? Any kind of a read on U.S non-resi from that? What's your take on that front?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">I think it's slightly different, Steve. I think it's more about the strength of the orders last year. We saw some really good orders, if you remember, last year Otis North America orders were up 10% on a year-over-year basis, which was off a strong 2017. So '18 was exceptional and we kind of expected our orders in North America this year for Otis to be slightly down. That's not a reflection on the market. It's just that extraordinary strength that Otis saw last year in the orders. We do still see good award level activity. So the non-residential construction activity is still pretty robust and strong. Awards are pretty good. We -- but I think the market is probably the best way to characterize it is stabilizing at the high levels in North America. There is a little bit of margin pressure, but overall market is stabilized.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And then one last quick one. You mentioned E&amp;D was up at Pratt, I think the guidance for the year has it being a bit of a tailwind. Is that related to middle of the market or anything like that or why is E&amp;D up there?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So E&amp;D is up really across Pratt. It includes both Pratt Canada as well as the large Commercial Engine business. For the full-year, we still expect E&amp;D to be flat. So it will be a tailwind in the back half of the year for Pratt. But there's, I would say minimal spending, although a little bit on the NMA, but that's not driving this. This is just other programs that we've got in the hopper.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey. Good morning, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hey, Ron.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Good morning, Ron.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">When you think about the investments that you can make across the entire franchise, I mean, what is the appetite to make new investments -- investments on new programs, specifically? I mean, where do we stand on NMA? Where do we stand on maybe the replacement of 737, that kind of stuff?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Look, Ron, I think you can't look at investment in a single year and make any type of determination. We are going to continue to invest across the aerospace portfolio and those markets where we think we’ve a significant advantage, the GTF is one of those. We are prepared to invest in the NMA. I think we can put in an offer to Boeing, which we hope is compelling, but if that doesn't happen we are going to continue to invest in the GTF technology so that we are ready for the next generation single-aisle, which we don't really think will get launched until probably 2025. So I would expect overall E&amp;D to kind of remain flattish at Pratt until such time as we have a brand new engine program. We are also -- as I think about the E&amp;D, it's not just Pratt, it's also across the Collins Aerospace business. We got a lot of great products there, be it avionics or electric power, the aerostructures business, all of which represent opportunities. And what we are really focused on is how do you innovate and have the next generation of technology ready when the aircraft manufacturers are ready.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Just one point to add on the Pratt side, Ron, I think Pratt Canada is a business we shouldn't ignore when we talk about investments because that’s clearly a crown jewel, as Greg has often mentioned and that’s a business where we continue to refresh our product line and continue to make sure that we’ve the latest product available for our customers, because that generate significant installed base and aftermarket on a continuous basis. So that's another area where investment continues.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Look, we are not going to step down the pace of E&amp;D spend. I think may be as a percentage of sales that will go down a little bit as we continue to see solid growth on the top line, but the absolute level of E&amp;D I would expect to remain relatively flat as we look to continue to stay ahead of the curve.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then just -- and I may, as a follow on, just quickly?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Sure.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">How does having Raytheon in the portfolio, if you will, or the combination change you’re thinking about that, right? I mean, Raytheon should be a fantastic source of additional capital, so on and so forth, right? So, I mean, how does that -- how does having Raytheon change that versus not having Raytheon?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Well, look, I think when you look at the cash flows of the combined company, you understand that some of these decisions as a standalone commercial aerospace business, it's a much bigger deal than as a combined aerospace and defense industry. But also I think it gives us the ability to capitalize on their technologies and for them to capitalize on our technologies. And with 60,000 engineers between the two companies, I got to believe we are going to find some savings on some of these programs as we are able to capitalize on each other's technology. But I think fundamentally what Raytheon gives us is the scale to compete anywhere anytime in any program that we choose to. And again, it's not that we are going to go chase everything, that's not the idea. We still want to be disciplined in where we put our capital, but I think, again, it's just a great opportunity for us to be able to continue to invest, but also to give a lot of cash back to shareowners over the next three to five years, and I think that's the beauty of the Raytheon merger.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks Ron.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you and good morning, gentlemen.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hey Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hey. Just a couple of cash flow related questions. First, do you expect to fully spend that $1.5 billion separation placeholder in 2019? And is that grand total number moving around at all as we look into 2020?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Still a little early, Jeff, to comment on the total number, but on the $1.5 billion, a lot of that as you can imagine, it relates to the tax costs as we do our legal entity restructuring. The good news is the team is working really, really hard and is on track, as of now, to achieve the steps that were critical. You will see probably a larger amount in Q3 associated with that as we do a lot of these legal entity restructurings. But will the exact number be $1.5 billion for the year? I don't know. And that's part of the reason why we didn't change our guidance for the $4.5 billion to $5 billion for the year, even though on the operational side we feel better about our outlook. The uncertainty associated with the separation cost related cash flow is why we've kept it where it is, but I'm still hopeful that overall we see little better news on cash flow than we have in the guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then also, just coming around to the S-4, I understand the unlevered free cash flow that we see there's different than the free cash flows defined typically in the world we operate in. But the numbers there do suggest that perhaps there's some upside to that kind of $8 billion number you laid out for 2021 post merger for the combined aero company. Am I interpreting that correctly? Can you address that at all?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">You’re absolutely interpreting that correctly. There will be about $1 billion difference at this point, if you do the math. I think it's easy for anybody to do that, but what I would tell you is two things. One is, what you see in the S-4 and what was used for valuation purposes were our internal plans. As you would expect, any reasonable management team to do is to not necessarily put that out as guidance. So we would -- when we gave you the $8 billion number that had a little bit of conservatism baked into that as a -- because I knew you would ask me that question in 2021. So I just wanted to make sure that, that number was something we could absolutely deliver on. And the second point is that there's still the discussion we were having earlier, even though these separations may happen by 2020 which are likely to happen by 2020 first quarter or second quarter at the latest, there may be some lingering tax payments associated with the separation activities, which may go into 2021 as we file returns in foreign jurisdictions and actually make cash payments in 2021 associated with the separation. So we kept a little room for that so -- but net-net you're right, operationally it should be high.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Look, I think the key thing there, Jeff, is that when we did the valuation of UTC Aerospace, we had full of cash flows of the businesses forecast and you've uncovered Akhil's little hedging technique there, which is probably not a surprise to anybody that knows Akhil. But the fact is we think we got full and fair value for all of those cash flows going forward and we will see what the -- what the other cash looks like as it relates to separation activity, but really it was just our own conservatism in terms of what we put out to the Street versus how we actually value the business.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Sorry, I couldn't wait to 2021 to ask the question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">That’s okay.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Jeff.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey, good morning, gentlemen.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good morning, Carter</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Just a follow-up quickly on that S-4 cash disclosure. I know that just from a methodology standpoint, there was, I guess, some difference in there and how it treated non-operational aerospace investing cash flows. Can you help explain what those were and maybe how much we should think that impacted that number that you -- that we see in the S-4?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So, Carter, this is something that we've talked about a little bit over the last couple of years as people have been looking at items below our free cash flow definition, the investing cash associated with the payments we make to Rolls Royce, the lease pool assets that we have -- put in place every year, some limited amount of customer financing that we do, right, all that stuff shows up in our investing cash flow below free cash flow number. So for purposes of relative valuations, since that is a relatively reliable number or outflow, it was only fair to reflect that in the unlevered cash flows for purposes of valuation of the company because that number will stay going forward. Now that will come down over time as we’ve talked. This year, it's probably between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, that number goes down below a $1 billion. As we move forward in time, lease pool assets won't be as high as they are. Customer financing will be a little bit less and the Rolls Royce payments have a finite life to it, they go away after 2027. So we took all that into account, but it was a fair cash call on our aero future cash flows.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So it's reasonable to assume that the Rolls payment is, as we know it's always been, you've got a leased pool build and then you got lease pool sales presumably at the back end of that forecast period?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Well, leased pool sales, I would say, is not something to rely on because if you think about it, the installed base will continue to grow. So the best way to think about that is that we won't necessarily add to the lease pool assets at the same rate that we have done in these first two years, but we typically don't see sale of leased pool assets till very late in the program. It's more about not continuing to build it at the same rate.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. I was just trying to get some perspective on the gross uppers and downers, if you will. So thanks for the clarification.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes, no problem.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Good morning. Maybe just circling back, nearer term, give a little bit of color as to how much of a slowdown in order intake and general customer activity you've seen in those global HVAC and refrigeration markets? Was this something that fell off late in Q2 or was it a steady sort of deceleration for three or four months?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">So, broadly speaking, Julian, I think the only place where I would say, we’ve been negatively surprised is Europe broadly speaking for the HVAC business, right? For the HVAC business or for the refrigeration business is the number Carroll quoted for Europe truck trailer orders, down over 25%; commercial refrigeration business was down near double-digit on that as well. In Europe, specifically which is where a big part of the business is. Commercial HVAC was also down in Middle East. As you know, it's down over 25%, I think in terms of that area. So I think Europe has been the one where the order decline has been greater than what we expected and probably a little bit of a surprise. The other places, I would say, is more of a compare issue than really a fundamental market issue at this point. It doesn't feel like that. North America residential, lots of people have talked about it, you understand it well. That's probably a cool start to the summer. I don't think there's fundamentally anything wrong with the market. The replacement cycle is still pretty strong; housing starts down this year, but we expect that to continue to grow as we go forward into the next year. So I think fundamental still okay there. It's the Europe market, which is probably a little weaker than we expected.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks. And then just my quick follow-up. Tying that may be to Otis, where you’ve seen very good improvement in service profitability for several quarters. Europe is obviously the biggest profit pool for that service business at Otis. So are you concerned at all if broader construction is slowing in Europe? Did that may start to impinge on pricing in service at Otis and eat into that service profit improvement?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Look, I think, we’ve been through a long cycle of pricing pressure in Europe on service and I think we have started to see that stabilize here in the last six quarters or so. And the focus is really going to be on how do we get productivity out of the technicians to offset whatever pricing pressure there's out there, but again, as these more modern machines get put into service, the ability of the independent service providers, the ISPs, to service the elevators becomes less as service becomes, in our words, little bit more sticky. And I think again, the more technology, the more we can offer the customers in terms of internet connectivity and predictive maintenance on these elevators, all of that goes to our ability to retain customers. And look, people typically don't change just for pricing, they change because of poor service. And what we’ve found is that the better our service quality is, the better -- lower our turn backs or call backs to lower issues that are -- or the fewer issues that we’ve with the machines, the better our retention rate is for those elevators. So I don't view this as a near-term or even a medium-term pricing issue. I think that we just have to continue to focus on the fundamentals of service in Europe and that will drive profit growth there.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, I think to put a data point that we talked about in the first quarter call as well, I think the most heartening data point for me in Europe service for Otis was that the hours per unit came down by about 5% in this quarter, after a decline in first quarter as well, and that's Europe, right. So Europe service is seeing productivity. Part of that is with the growth in the repair business, in the -- outside of the maintenance. So that’s helping as well, but certainly the service transformation initiatives that Otis has been working on for a long time is -- are starting to bear fruit now.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Peter Arment</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes, thanks. Good morning, Greg, Akhil.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Peter Arment</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Greg, just on Collins Aerospace, just specifically on the commercial aftermarket. The higher outlook that you're giving there now, high single-digit growth, obviously a very strong first half, just maybe some insight on to the -- how you're thinking about the second half. I mean it seems like, are you expecting ADS-B volume to start to fall off or how you're thinking about what the provision and demand will be, just given this outlook? Appreciate it.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Maybe a couple of points there. In terms of ADS-B, as you guys know, the mandate is that by the end of this year, all of the U.S operators have to have the upgraded ADS-B. There will be some carry on into next year some of the other smaller operators, the European operators also get their upgrades. I think you’ve to look at provisioning not just as a single quarter though. We said -- I think Akhil said it, provisioning was up over 30% in the quarter and well that’s wonderful, it is not sustainable. And so I think we will try to put a reasonable back half forecast in front of people understanding that you're not going to get 30% type provisioning increases year-over-year, but we still feel very good about the market. I think what we're seeing repair and put is good on the Collins side. Spare part sales are still good, and people are flying a lot. And I think while it's bad news for that the 737 MAX isn't flying, it means that some of the older aircraft have to remain in service a little bit longer and that's also driving some of this volume. So as we think about this, I wouldn't get too excited about the first half. It's great performance across the business. But it's not going to repeat at this level in the back half. If it does, great, you will see it. You will see it in the earnings, you will see in the top line, you will see in the bottom line. But in terms of our guidance, we are not expecting this level of activity to continue.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Peter Arment</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Appreciate the color. Thanks, Greg.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Rajeev Lalwani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time. Greg, Akhil, when coming back to the S-4 and some of the information in there, clearly you're providing some pretty good numbers as far as growth going forward. I think it implies, once you take into account capital return, somewhere in the mid-teens. One, is that right? And then two, what's the risk to all of that? You obviously caveated it in terms of maybe some potential incremental investments on engines and so on. So just trying to get comfortable with; one, is that opportunity really that big? And then two, what's the risk to it really materializing?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I think the biggest point that you made Rajeev is the risk associated and Bob Leduc mentioned this, so this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody is NMA investment, right. If we were fortunate enough to win the NMA -- if NMA is to be launched and we win the engine on that, that would definitely be an investment not contemplated in those numbers. What is also not contemplated, to some extent, probably -- this is business as usual internal plans that were put out there, right. There's also incremental and near-term, there could be some pressures associated with restructuring investments that we need to make in the business to continue to drive margins in the long-term. And as Greg said, if there is additional opportunities that come in front of Collins Aerospace that are associated with NMA or something else, you could see some. So this is business as usual, internal plans driving the businesses to better performance, as you would expect us to do, but there are always risks out there which -- or investments needed which can sometimes dampen that outlook a little bit.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes, I would just add to that, I think, look, this was a -- our best, most reasonable forecast that we put forward that we shared and felt comfortable sharing with Raytheon and the bankers as we went through the valuation. We try not to put everything, including the kitchen sink into this valuation. We wanted it to stand on its own. At the same time, I believe there's both upside as well as some downside risk. And the upside, as Akhil said, is we’ve more to do on margins at Pratt. We’ve to invest in automation, we’ve to invest in the factories, we’ve to invest to take the cost down even further than what's laid out on these plans. And all of that should lead potentially to higher margins, but it also require higher capital investments, higher cash investments on the restructuring, which are not in there. So we think it's a very balanced view of the business going forward, taking full benefit of course for the GTF investments that we've made over the last 10 or 12 years.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Rajeev Lalwani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks. Just one quick clarification, but is my characterization in terms of that, growth potential, once you take into account capital return, something sort of mid-teens or so over the next five years, could it be that high?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">You don't do capital returns from a point of time, right, because I mean if -- that would be ignoring all the investments we’ve made in the business in GTF, for example. I mean, obviously looking forward, I think we've talked about this before, Rajeev. If I look at engine campaigns for GTF to pick one example, we generally have low-to-mid teens returns on every engine campaign. That's our goal. But when I factor all of the investments in E&amp;D and capital and everything else made the GTF program overall, it is not a mid-teens return. It's above cost of capital, but it's more close to double-digit type of thing, right. So I think it depends on what your starting point is and what investment you want to consider, the returns would change. I think the good news is that all these investments generate returns in excess of cost of capital and if you look isolated just on a look forward, it would be in the low to mid teens type of thing that you're talking about -- yes, or it could be higher.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Rajeev Lalwani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">I will leave it there. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks. Good morning.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning, Nigel.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good morning. Akhil, I just wanted to go back to your comments about the resi HVAC market flat to down. Is that a volume unit forecast or would that be revenues? And this gets to my question about pricing, are we seen pricing discipline continuing in light of the weaker conditions in that market?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Good -- very good point, Nigel. What I was talking about was volume, so units essentially is what I was talking about. When you take pricing into account, you do see maybe some up -- a positive number on the market from a value perspective, but yes in terms of units, it's flat to down. Pricing has been reasonably good. I think the second quarter, as Carroll mentioned in his comments, we saw pricing more than offset -- significantly more than offset actually the commodities, logistics and other input cost increases. So we’re seeing the pricing state at this point, obviously a lot depends on how the summer plays out as you know this market well, and also what happens in the future with any tariffs or anything else. So it's something we watch on a day-to-day basis, but the good news is that at least through the first half we’ve seen pricing stick and fall through to the bottom line.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And then, my follow-on is really about the back half guidance. You're pointing towards, I think the math is 50 to 100 of EBIT growth in the back half for Carrier. How much visibility do we’ve around raw material deflation benefits or specific cost actions that get us -- give us confidence that we can generate that level of growth in the back half? And I’m curious …</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">… whether transportation business could be a headwind, given the negative order development there. Do we’ve a headwind from transportation in the back half of the year?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">At this point, I think the backlog was still okay for the transportation, to answer your second question first. So I think we're still relying on some level of growth in the refrigeration business in the back half. Clearly, we will need orders to get a little bit better than what we’ve seen in the second quarter. So definitely the good news or the expectation of earnings and sales growth in the second half rely on improving order trends. The things which are positive for Carrier, as we look in the back half is improving raw material headwind, as you point out, commodities, tariffs, all that becomes a little easier, logistic costs on a year-over-year basis comparisons become easier. Plus Dave and Bob McDonough before him, have done a 1,000 people headcount reduction that we see some benefits coming through as that headcount action took place in Q2, etcetera, we see the benefits of that coming through in the second half as well. So restructuring actions, easier compares on commodities, logistics, tariffs etcetera, FX as the other element, when you take all that into account, some things to rely on as we look at second half, but clearly also relying on improvement in the order trends.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Okay. Thanks very much.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen &amp; Company. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, thank you very much. So your guide assumes high teens commercial aero aftermarket at Legacy UTAS, which would, I think mid-teens or mid-to-low teens in the second half. Give us some color on the sequential trend over the last couple of months in aftermarket. And at one point, you guys talked of $0.10 negative hit if the MAX is out for the entire year. How does that factor into your thinking currently?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, I think to answer your second question first, Cai, it's still the same estimate. We -- I think you've heard from Boeing as well, they're assuming 42 per month type of production through their end of the year. We had calibrated that in our first quarter call, as up to $0.10 and that number still stands. So that is baked into the forecast and Collins was able to raise its outlook in spite of that headwind, so that's certainly good news. With regard to the aftermarket, I think the point I will come back to and Greg mentioned this a little bit as well is, if you look at provisioning, Cai, a lot of the strength we saw in the second quarter at the heritage UTAS business came from stocking orders from the MRO shops, right, with some constraints on supply with the grounding of 737 MAX and no new supply coming in for that aircraft. Clearly, the incentive is and with the traffic still staying robust, the incentive is for all airlines and MRO operators to ensure that the existing fleet is not on the ground for very long at all, if at all, right. And the one way to ensure that is to make -- to be clear that all the parts that may be required for repairing something are available on site and where it is needed. So we saw some stocking orders, which drove exceptional performance, which is great to see and helped us raise our full-year, but to count on that to happen again and repeat itself in the second half would probably not be appropriate and would not be the right call to make. So that’s -- what we have assumed that second half slows down a little bit, still grows nicely. And as Greg said, if it comes in stronger, you will see it in our numbers.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I guess my question was, it has to slow, it would look like to a level, still slightly above 10% that's still pretty good, if we’ve any slowing and destocking and more impact from the MAX.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, I think part of that is exactly what -- yes, what you said, Cai, I think because of the MAX you -- we continue to expect a reasonably strong second half relative to first half, it will be smaller, but relative to year-over-year or normal trends, it will be stronger. So that's the benefit that will definitely be there. You're exactly right.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you very much.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask about the Pratt aftermarket and maybe Akhil, could you give us what the aftermarket growth would have been without the PW4000 adjustments?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carroll Lane</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes, Myles, I mean the aftermarket is doing very well overall. If you think about the organic demand for V2500 shop visits, it's still a 1,000 shop visits or better. And if you think about the step up in inductions that we saw sequentially, very strong, obviously. You take out the PW4000 contract adjustment, you are probably at that mid-single digit overall aftermarket growth. So really the question in terms of getting to the full-year, mid-single digit is just one of execution in the back half, can you get as many these through the shops worldwide as -- is there demand -- the demand remains very strong.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">And that 4000, look, was that customer-specific driven or is that an overall look at the market and kind of -- you are kind of forward look as to the demand and profit looking on that specific engine platform?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carroll Lane</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">No, I mean we look at individual customer fleets on a regular basis, assess the cost of the individual contracts. In the case of this quarter, when we looked at some PW4000 contracts, which is obviously a smaller fleet than the Vs, we had a bit higher costs on several contracts. So the good news is we’ve repair development going on continuously to reduce any additional wear modes on some of these older engines because that's what they’re. These are engines that are in the later stages of their life. So, it's a part of doing business and we feel very good about the Pratt aftermarket overall.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Okay, got it. And just one clarification on the slide that talks about favorable large commercial engine mix. Is that implying that you had lower GTFs year-on-year as proportional to the mix or is that implying something specific to the contracts in the GTF deliveries?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">No, it's more about the lower GTFs, because if you remember, last year second quarter was a very strong. It was bit of a catch up quarter, right, after the issue we had in the first quarter last year, with the knife-edge seal. The recovery from that took place in the second quarter, so there was a much higher value -- volume of shipments.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">There's also a mix issue in terms of -- there's the second element which is probably a smaller contributor to the whole thing is the customers to whom the sales were made, right, that’s the point you’re making about contract. I think that -- there's a little contribution from that as well. And the third element I would say is, sales of some spare engines, right, because as customers are getting confidence in the configuration that we have out in the market now, they’re willing to invest in some leads -- some spare engines themselves as oppose to requiring us to hold all of the spare engine pools.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Carroll Lane</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Myles, the other thing we had going on at Pratt this quarter, we don’t talk enough about is Pratt Canada. You had shipments up and really shipments up across all categories, regional was up, corporate was up, rotorcraft was up. So just feeling pretty good about things at Canada, which was a contributor to the OEM line this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Myles Walton</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Got it. Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Hey. Good morning, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Good morning, Noah.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Good morning, Noah.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Just one quick follow-up to that, Pratt aftermarket topic which is, is the V2500 inspection issue that you had at the two MRO shops that started last quarter, is that fully 100% resolved or does it linger slightly? And then, I wanted to ask on Collins the synergy increase, on a percentage basis, is pretty large for year one. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit on where you're finding that and is there a new multiple-year out synergy number?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Greg Hayes</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. So I will start on the V question. We’ve redeployed those engines and we’ve the capacity that we think we need. Really the question is just getting them through the shops, right, because you had delayed inductions and it's a tightly coupled system. So I think the issues that kind of precipitated the disruption have been resolved. But we still have a lot of work to do to get the engines through the shop from an execution standpoint.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Akhil Johri</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">And the Collins increase, Noah, that's -- again, it's great to see we are -- looking at about $200 million synergies in the first year. And so the $600 million number that you're referring to which was the increased number that Kelly showed in Paris could have some upside. Hopefully that's what Kelly and team are driving to. I’m highly confident that they're not stopping at $600 million as -- like we did in the case of Goodrich, we will continue to drive the synergies. The good news is that we are seeing that level of cost benefits in the first quarter itself. It's in two areas. SG&amp;A, as you would imagine in the first year, generally that’s where you get it and then it's indirect supply that's where the other part of the benefit comes from. So I think the team is focused on driving as high synergy number as we can and $200 million is a good start for first year.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">All right. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Hayes for any closing remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Greg Hayes</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Okay. Thank you, Sonia. First of all, thanks for listening today. As always, Carroll and the whole IR team will be available all day to answer your questions. Please feel free to give him a call and thanks to all for listening. Take care.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Brady Connor</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Brett. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor and I'm here with Hans Vestberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Before I get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now let's take a look at consolidated earnings for the period. For the second quarter of 2019, we reported earnings of $0.95 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pretax charge of approximately $1.5 billion related to early debt redemption costs. The impact after tax was approximately $1.1 billion or $0.28 per share, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.23. This represents growth of 2.5% on an adjusted basis compared to $1.20 a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Let's now move to slide four and take a closer look at our earnings profile for the second quarter. Consistent with the approach we discussed last quarter, we have illustrated the ongoing impacts to earnings from the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition as well as the adoption of ASC 842 for leases. As we pointed out last quarter, we expect a smaller benefit in 2019 than we realized last year from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the deferral of commission expense. The reduction and benefit creates a year-over-year headwind to both reported earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. The impact was a $0.03 headwind in the quarter and $0.06 year-to-date. As a reminder, this headwind is expected to continue until the end of 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">At the beginning of this year, we adopted accounting standard ASC 842 for leases, which resulted in the gross-up on the balance sheet for all operating leases. In addition, the lease standard affects our earnings per share, primarily due to the expensing of certain lease costs. As highlighted previously, we expect this result in a $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter headwind on earnings per share throughout 2019. For the second quarter, this headwind was $0.01 on the earnings per share.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">As you can see on the slide, the 2.5% growth in adjusted EPS includes both the impacts from the deferral of commission expense related to the revenue recognition standard and the adoption of the leasing standard. This highlights the strong underlying performance of the business. Matt will take you through the details and key drivers later in the call.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">With that I'll now turn the call over to Hans. </p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>Hans Vestberg</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thanks, Brady, and thanks, everybody, for joining this second quarter earnings call. We had a strong second quarter. It was fueled by a very good wireless service revenue growth as well as a strong EPS -- adjusted EPS growth as well. So I think the team had a good quarter with a lot of focus on the execution. At the same time our operation metrics was good with net additions on the wireless side, as well as a very low churn.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">That in combination with a very solid capital allocation, as well as efficiency coming out from our capital allocation process, all-in-all all stranded up to a very good cash flow. So if I sum it up very quickly, a very good quarter from us financially.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Together with our work in the network which is so important to us when we're building our network as a service, we also won all the top third-party measurements. We won from J.D. Power, the 23rd consecutive time, when account the RootMetrics, the 12th straight win there as well. So we are really getting the right feedback from the market and the measurements that is really valuable in this market.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">At the same time, we won some more spectrum in the millimeter-wave auction, which is now adding up to our portfolio which means that we have a portfolio for the 5G-era where we can build capacity and we can build coverage, which we said all the time, we want to be in the real 5G with all the 8 currencies that I've talked about before.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also have launched quite a lot of CTLs lately adding up, so we are on-track for the 30 markets that we have said we will do this year. At the same time we continue to add new devices to the portfolio, the latest one was the Inseego, MiFi and 5G device that we launched recently and we're now four different devices on 5G.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We're also very focused on the fiber because ultimately if you're going to the 5G, you need fiber. Our fiber deployment is now in more than 60 cities and we had 1,400 route miles a month in average in this quarter which means that we increase on the first quarter continued this so important build for our overall Intelligent Edge Network and for the 5G deployment we're doing.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">When it comes to Verizon 2.0 won a transformation one of the proof points of course today that we now are reporting Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group as segments in the earnings release that we're doing today.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">I can also say that, we get a lot of good traction with our customers especially with enterprise customers with the new support and the new go-to-market we have, where we can show the full portfolio of Verizon and seeing that we have the right support also for the people in the line, meeting our customers everyday.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">At the same time we continued Network as a service concept, where we are now announced our collaboration with YouTube TV where we're going to offer up both our Fios customers, but also the wireless customers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Again working on the motto where we outlined earlier this year, how we can partner with some of these content players instead of investing ourselves in it and seeing that we can bring your seamless service for our customer, but also making it very efficient for ourselves and for our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We also have continued and finalized the Voluntary Separation Program in the quarter and we have done quite a lot of that and that in total now puts us up to have a competitive cost base and actually down quite a lot of these changes recently. So I would say that we are doing this transformation from a positional strength, and I'm really proud of the team that have done all of these changes and transformation in the last 12 months and delivering these results at the same time. And it really sets us up for continue to be very competitive in this market and definitely continue to be the leader in this market. So, I'm proud of the team and what we're producing this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">By that, I hand it over to Matt to go over the financials more in detail.</p>, <p class=""p p3""><strong>Matt Ellis</strong></p>, <p class=""p p3"">Thanks, Hans, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with a recap of our consolidated operating and financial results. On a reported basis, second quarter consolidated revenue was $32.1 billion, which was down slightly as compared to the prior year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and wireline service revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">On a year-to-date basis, consolidated revenue is up slightly at 0.4%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP consolidated revenue guidance of low single-digit percentage growth for 2019. On a consolidated basis, second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7%, which was up from 36.8% in the prior year and includes headwinds of approximately 80 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the impact of the lease accounting standard that Brady mentioned earlier.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Adjusted EBITDA increased more than $200 million or 1.8% over the prior year due to wireless service revenue performance as well as continued improvement in operational efficiencies across the business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our business excellence initiatives have realized cumulative cash savings of $4.1 billion since the program started in 2018. We have now completed all three phases of our Voluntary Separation Program and have realized approximately $480 million of expense savings year-to-date.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">With the last tranche of employees exiting in late June, we expect additional incremental savings in the third quarter. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $10 billion of cumulative cash savings by 2021.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As Brady mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.23, up from $1.20 a year ago. The increase in our earnings per share was driven by growth of more than $200 million in adjusted EBITDA slightly offset by a higher tax rate. The higher tax rate resulted in an approximately $0.01 headwind to adjusted earnings per share.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As a reminder last year's tax rate included certain one-time benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which do not repeat this year. For 2019, our adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to come in at the lower end of the 24% to 26% range.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Continued wireless service revenue momentum and solid margin performance keep us on track to achieve our guidance of low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS excluding the impact of the new lease accounting standard. Our expectation of the lease accounting headwind remains unchanged to approximately $0.04 to $0.08 for full year 2019.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now, let's move on to the review of the new operating segments under Verizon 2.0 starting with consumer on slide 7. As a reminder, our new consumer segment encompasses both wireless and wireline products and services targeting retail customers as well as our wireless wholesale operations.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the second quarter, total consumer operating revenue was $22.0 billion, which is flat compared to the prior year. These results were primarily driven by continued strong growth in wireless service revenue and file service offerings offset by declines in wireless equipment and legacy wireline services.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Consumer wireless service revenue increased by 2.5%, driven by customer step-ups to unlimited plans and migration within Unlimited to higher tier plans as well as an increase in connections per account. Less than 50% of our customer account base are on unlimited plans.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the second quarter consumer wireless equipment revenue decreased 8.2% as lower upgrade rates more than offset an increase in phone gross adds. Consumer Fios revenue increased by 1.2% due primarily to the demand for our broadband offerings. Consumer EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 46.5%, which was up 80 basis points from the prior year. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and a new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Let's now turn to slide 8 and take a closer look at consumer operating metrics. Within consumer, wireless performance is very strong, while operating in a highly competitive environment. Phone net additions were 73,000 for the quarter as compared to 17,000 last year including postpaid smartphone net additions of 209,000, up 17% from the prior year. This was driven by phone gross additions, which are up more than 5% year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Postpaid net additions totaled 126,000 including other connected device net additions of 187,000, primarily wearables offset by tablet net losses of 134,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.72% improved sequentially due to focused retention efforts around our high-value customer base as well as normal seasonal patterns. This performance was in line with last year strong results. Our superior network quality and personalized offerings continue to resonate with our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Total retail postpaid churn of 0.97% was up compared to 0.93% last year. Total postpaid device activations, of which 81% were phones, were down 7.6%. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.3%, down from 5. 1% a year ago, reflecting the continued elongation of the handset upgrade cycle.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the second quarter, prepaid net losses were 213,000 compared to a loss of 236,000 last year. We continue to focus on high-value account and profitability in our retail prepaid wireless offerings.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Fios Internet net additions of 28,000 were driven by continued demand for our high-quality fiber broadband products. Fios Video losses totaled 52,000 as consumers continue to adopt over-the-top video services to replace traditional linear video offerings.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now let's move to our business segment on slide 9. Our business segment includes wireless and wireline products and services provided across four customer groups; Global Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Wholesale and Public Sector and Other, which includes Verizon Connect. Total operating revenues for the business segment decreased 1.1% in the quarter as growth in wireless services and our high-quality fiber products were offset by ongoing secular pressure from legacy technologies.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the quarter, revenue from our business wireless products grew 5.6% including 6.1% wireless service revenue growth. This strong performance reflects Verizon's best-in-class network quality, reliability and solutions-based approach with our business customers. Revenue from our wireline products declined 7.6% in the quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">From a Customer Group perspective, Global Enterprise and wholesale declined 4.8% and 15.1% respectively, driven primarily by legacy pricing pressure and technology shifts. Small and medium business revenue increased 5.4% driven by wireless service and Fios growth partially offset by ongoing declines in traditional data and voice services.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Public sector and other revenue increased 3.8% as a result of growth in wireless and wireline products and services. Business segment EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.3% which was down 20 basis points compared to the prior year driven by declines in legacy wireline product revenues. This includes headwinds of approximately 10 basis points from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standard as previously mentioned.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Now let's move on to slide 10 to discuss business operating metrics. Business wireless is transforming consistent and strong. Postpaid net adds were 325,000 which includes 172,000 phones 90,000 tablets and 63,000 other connected devices.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Phone churn of 0.97% improved sequentially, while total postpaid churn of 1.21% increased 5 basis points compared to the prior year. Total postpaid device activations were up slightly at 0.6%, while our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 4.2% down from 4.6% in the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's now move on to slide 11 to discuss Verizon Media Group. For the second quarter Verizon Media Group revenue is $1.8 billion which was down 2.9% versus the prior year, a significant improvement from the 7.2% year-over-year decline reported in the first quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Gains in native and mobile advertising continue to be offset by declines in desktop advertising though the business continues to build on positive momentum in key areas. We are continuing to migrate customers to our recently integrated advertising platforms, simplifying interactions with partners and driving synergies within the business.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We remain focused on growing our audience, engagement and monetization across our super channels which includes sports, finance, news, entertainment, home and mail. During the quarter we launched Yahoo! Finance Premium and HuffPost Plus which is a subscription services that enhance the experience of two of our most popular media assets.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's now move to slide 12, which reconciles Verizon 2.0 results to our legacy Verizon 1.0 results. As we mentioned during our Verizon 2.0 segment reporting webcast in mid June, we will be providing overall wireless and wireline results through the remainder of this year. You can find these results in our supplemental information included on our website.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Slide 12 shows a reconciliation from Verizon 2.0 to Verizon 1.0 for both consumer and business revenue. The voice full chart shows the bridge from consumer revenue to wireless and from business revenue to wireline.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The top chart shows consumer which had $22.0 billion of revenue in the quarter. The subtraction of consumer wireline removes $3.1 billion and the addition of business wireless brings in $3.8 billion resulting in total wireless revenues of $22.7 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">The bottom chart shows a similar reconciliation from business to wireline revenue. We start with business revenue of $7.8 billion subtract $3.8 billion of business wireless and $0.2 billion of Verizon Connect and then add $3.1 billion of consumer wireline to ultimately arrive at total wireline revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter. Total wireline operating revenues in the quarter declined 4.5% while wireline margins were 19.3%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's move to slide 13, which highlights our overall legacy wireless results. Looking at overall wireless results, which includes both consumer and business wireless, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.0% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by a 3.1% increase in service revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect overall wireless service revenue growth to be within the mid 2% to 3% range. Total wireless EBITDA margin as a percentage of total revenue in the quarter was 48.2%. This includes headwinds of approximately 100 basis points, primarily from the deferral of commission expense and the new lease accounting standards as previously mentioned.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Excluding the impact from the accounting standards, second quarter EBITDA margin was 49.2%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Total postpaid net adds were 451,000 in the quarter. This includes phone net adds of 245,000, which were up from 199,000 a year ago. Postpaid smartphone net additions in the quarter were 420,000. Postpaid phone churn of 0.76% was similar to last year while total retail postpaid churn of 1.02% was up five basis points year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">For the quarter, we increased customer accounts by 8,000 as compared to a loss of 24,000 in the second quarter of last year. Total postpaid device activations were down 5.7%. This was driven by an increase in postpaid growth additions of 3.9 million from 3.8 million in the prior year offset by a decrease in our retail postpaid upgrade rate to 4.3% from 5.0% a year ago.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Let's now focus on our consolidated cash flow results and the balance sheet on slide 14. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities totaled $15.8 billion, down from $16.4 billion during the prior year. Benefits from operational improvements were offset by a higher cash tax payments and payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. The one-time benefits realized last year related to tax reform were primarily recognized in the first half of 2018.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Capital spending for the first half of the year was $8.0 billion, which is up slightly from the prior year. Our capital expenditures continue to support the growth in data and video traffic on our industry leading 4G LTE network, the launch and continued build-out of our 5G Ultra Wideband network, the upgrade to our Intelligent Edge Network architecture and significant fiber deployment in 60-plus markets outside our ILEC footprint.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We maintain our full-year 2019 CapEx guidance range of $17.0 billion to $18.0 billion. The net results of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow for the first half of the year of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of total gross debt, which is $1.3 billion lower than the prior year. The unsecured debt balance was $102.1 billion which is lower year-over-year by $3.9 billion and lower sequentially by $1.2 billion.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.1 times versus our targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times and is down from 2.3 times last year, reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet. We continue to actively manage our debt portfolio to minimize near-term maturities, optimize our overall funding footprint and lower our cost of capital.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">During the quarter we tendered $4.5 billion of notes that resulted in the pretax charge of $1.5 billion that Brady mentioned earlier. The charge is predominantly non-cash. Our balance sheet strength provide us with financial flexibility to execute on our strategy. We continue to maintain near-term maturities at low levels giving us confidence to operate and invest throughout the business cycle.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So in summary, second quarter saw a continuation of our strong performance while we made the transition to Verizon 2.0. We grew customer relationships and increased service revenues.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The growth in our earnings was driven by operational performance from the business which also led to strong cash flow results for the quarter. We continue to be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and we remain committed to strengthening our balance sheet.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">With that, I'll turn the call over to Brady, so we can get to your questions. </p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Brady Connor</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks, Matt. Brad, we're now ready to take questions. </p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Philip Cusick</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thanks guys. One short term and one long-term, if I may. First your 2.5% to 3% service revenue growth guide seems very conservative at this point versus 2.7% on the first half. Are there headwinds in the back half that we should think will get the average down below 3%?</p>, <p class=""p p6"">And second, Hans can you dig more into the 60 market fiber build? And help us understand any early progress on in-sourcing backhaul, as well as when you will start marketing that to consumer or business out of region? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Let me start with the wireless service growth and then Matt will come back on that. But I think that, the team has really shown a really good work here in the last couple of quarters since, I would say, we have this new structure.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">I'm confident we have a good momentum in our business. Rolling on the team probably have some more quarters up their sleeves, thinking how they will continue to compete in this market. So we think it's our at least, I have a lot of confidence in the team we’re rolling on and continue to progress on the service revenue growth that we have done so far.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">On the fiber build, yes that's a very important build for us. And we have been on for that for quite a while right now and the speed in this quarter was 1400 route miles per month in average in the quarter. Remember in the first quarter we talked about 1000, so definitely everywhere coming up.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Right now the majority of the fiber is going to our own sites to build, if I may say. But over time of course when we roll in later in part of this year next year, we're also going to be able to offer that to our enterprise customers and wholesale et cetera. So that's how we're working right now and we're building it in 60 more and because it is just so essential for the whole Intelligent Edge Network, it's so essential for the whole 5G play that we have to have this fiber. So we have a good speed now. The team has been there on for quite a while, and so it will take a little bit longer before we can offer it to all our customers. But mainly I would say we're right now we're taking to our own sites, which is very important improvement for our efficiency. Matt?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Yeah. So good morning Phil. So on the service revenue, certainly pleased with the results we've seen in the first half of the year, 3.1% in second quarter, driven by over 6% in the business segment. So great momentum in the wireless products and services across both segments as we head into the second half of the year. We like the momentum we have as we jump off into second half and we'll wait and see how the back half of the year plays out in terms of the total service revenue growth. We certainly see a continued path to continue on the service revenue growth we've had for over a year or so now.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Philip Cusick</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And Hans if I can follow-up the in-sourcing of your backhaul as you take fiber to your sites, has that really begun to start lowering cost, or are you not starting to light that up yet?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">We have been starting, but of course today on the total cost we have, it's not significant yet. But this is all part of the Intelligent Edge Network, the multipurpose network we're building and that's what you're seeing in our CapEx, the last two years the efficiencies. And as you remember Kyle talked about the Intelligence Edge network build is going a couple of year more. So we, of course, believe that we have more efficient as it come out and one of them is definitely the fiber, which we're now building that definitely should get a their own economics long-term and also remember that -- also that this is a growth opportunity for us as well in certain areas.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Philip Cusick</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks, Phil. Hey, Brett, we’re ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thank you. The next question will come from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Brett Feldman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Thanks for taking the questions. This one's for Matt. As you show on slide 14, you're getting very close to achieving the net unsecured leverage target you outlined at your analyst meeting a couple of months ago. Is it a question as you get down to two churns of leverage and below, how do you think about prioritizing the incremental capital you'll be generating at that point? Should we think about that as dry powder for spectrum, which you may be look to flex up on CapEx a bit, or are we actually getting closer to a point where share repurchases become a higher and more immediate priority? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">So let me start here and this is of course something that me and Matt is working with confidence. Remember what we outlined in February, we're very clear and disciplined where our capital allocation. Number one into the business, the CapEx you have seen what we have done with the CapEx the last couple of years. We do everything we need and we are on historical levels and we will continue to be very disciplined there.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Secondly, we want to put our Board in a position to make a dividend that we have been working and ultimately we work with our debt. That's how we work all the time. So it’s business, dividend and debt.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And we -- want to continue this commitment that we made to get into this range and remember that was a commitment longer before me, but as you know we are company to always deliver on the commitments. So that's why it's important and ultimately we will get there. We will get optionality to our board to have a great conversation what we’re going to do with it. That's how I see it. And then of course Matt is working with this daily to see that we have the right balance sheet structure and the capital allocation of the company. Matt?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes Hans. So thanks for those points. And just building may be on the back end of that. So as you said Brett, we are -- we're as close as we’ve been to that range in the past 5-plus years. And – so, we're making good progress to get there and that comes from having strong results that drive good cash flow and you see the progress we've been able to make.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But just a couple of add-on points to what Hans said. It's a range that we say we want to be instead of long term. That means, we don't want to go past the 1.75 end of that range either. And so get into the range and then be in the range. And then we also don't expect to build up cash on the balance sheet beyond our normal operating level.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So as we get into the range we look at the opportunities priority number one, which is to invest in the business and the rest of the items that Hans talk about. We'll then decide the most appropriate use of cash that we may have to drive long-term value for our shareholders.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Brett Feldman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">All right. Thanks Brett. Hey Brad we are ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thank you. The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Simon Flannery</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks. Good morning. Hans I wonder if you could update us a little bit more on here 5G. You talked a bit about opening up the new mobile broadband market. Perhaps if you can talk about your learning so far and where we stand on expanding 5G Home? I think you've talked before about new markets later this year and dynamic spectrum sharing. How is that panning out? And when do we expect to see that hitting the Verizon network? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks. Great questions. So on the 5G, you have seen our progress in the quarter. We have basically now launched nine markets on the way to get to the 30 that we have talked about for the full year.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">You can also see on the 5G Mobility, how the improvements has gone extremely fast. I mean, take a couple of the cities where we basically have doubled the footprint in this since we launched the markets and that's this pace we're onto.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">At the same time we are going from roughly having 600 megabits in speed on the handset now we're doing easily 1.3, 1.5 and averaging up to 2 gig. What I want to tell you is that the development we're doing on technology is actually extremely fast compared to what I saw in 4G. And remember I was part of 4G as well.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I mean we are here to quarter into all these nine markets we have launched, we have launched with all the three infrastructure vendors we have which means that, we are coming out from sort of your scaling in the beginning, getting all the technology to work and now again starts our scaling. At the same time we are now three handsets and we have the Inseego MiFi that we launched which is sort of a business proposition as well for 5G.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So I think that, that's what you see. We see a great improvement. But still it's a lot of the intelligent antenna sort of technology that we're developing. The team is out in the field every day. So I'm confident that we will continue to do well here.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">And remember now in 5G out of wideband that we're doing right now. We're doing that in the most dense populated areas where really 5G is coming to its right, you know, with a fantastic sort of the performance there. So that's it.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">When we then talk about the 5G Home, you're absolutely right. I said that later this year we're going to launch 5G or 5G Home with and/or chipset. So that will come back, so there's no changes to those plans. Ultimately your question about DSS, which is dynamic spectrum sharing, which is an important piece for anyone that wants to do coverage on 5G. That is still coming in the first half of next year.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">But in our case what I said before, the most important is to get our customer the best experience. We have the best experience on 4G right now. We are just giving an extraordinary experience on the Ultra Wideband. We're going to be in the position to give optionality when we turn that off/on and we're going to turn it on with coverage and capacity when we see it's a benefit for our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">But I would say the activity level in the engineering team, the team working on the ground in every city, doing the fiber is extremely high in Verizon right now. So I think our focus is absolutely in the right place to see that our network is the number one. I remember also what I said previously, the 4G network now continue to win all the third-party awards. I mean, RootMetrics, J.D. Power in this quarter, so we're not neglecting that part neither. So you need to think about that when you have a customer in front of you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Simon Flannery</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Great. Thanks a lot.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Simon. Brett, we’re ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">David Barden</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could. One for Matt. If we're guiding for the low end of the tax rate for 2019, should we be then thinking that we're steering our earnings per share growth up, or are there other things in the mix that we shouldn't be taking that improvement right to the bottom line?</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then the second question would be, just with respect to the legacy 1.0 reporting for the business segment. I think one of the surprises that came out of the AT&amp;T result was the strength that they showed relative to history in the enterprise business and they talked about price stability, and other things I think Randall said that this was good at outlook as you have for that unit for some time. I think that the performance that Verizon didn't seem to kind of reflect the same strength. But I'm wondering if it had something to do with the reorganization in the quarter and we should start to see some improvement there. I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. I can start with the last question there about the business side of it. And I think that when it comes to what you called out the wireline business, I mean it was little bit blended, little bit tougher on the enterprise side. But on the other hand the governmental business and the small and medium have a good growth for us. So I think we see a very good possibility to continue to see that with the accelerates, sort of, the decline in enterprise. We have great funnel in the enterprise business as well.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I remember I mean there's no impact of the reorganization we have done. I mean I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey the changes we have done in the last 12 months compared to what we've done in the last five to 10 years and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a transformation from a positional strength and then, which will set us up to be even stronger going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And, of course, Tam and our team are working daily with our customers and as I said also in my previously, I mean the excitement from -- enterprise customers when we come with the full portfolio, so be it fiber or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution, mobile edge compute. I think we have a good and compelling story to continue to work on there. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining in the enterprise side which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that accelerated all the time. Matt?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. So David, on the ETR, so as I look at that, remind you that on a year-over-year basis the adjusted ETR is actually is up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and largely that's because of the onetime impacts a year ago from the adoption of the tax reform.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So we do see that continuing to be higher year-over-year. But despite that the EPS in the quarter was up $0.03 even with some headwind from the ETR on a year-over-year basis and also approximately $0.04 of headwind from the accounting standard. So kind of similar to the first quarter, so good EPS performance year-over-year in both first quarter and second quarter, strong momentum there for us.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">We jumped off into the second half of the year and so I feel good about where we are so far this year and we'll see how the back end plays out, but certainly a very strong platform to be building from. </p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">David Barden</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, David. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">John Hodulik</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thanks. Two questions, first on the 5G Home. Hans how should we think about the expansion of the 5G Home footprint once you get the standards-based equipment? And anything you could tell us on sort of growth in the target market or higher expected subscriber base to grow out?</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And then second base -- the second question is on spectrum. Obviously you guys control less spectrum then your current competitors and with a T-Mobile Sprint deal, we're looking at coming with over 300 megahertz of spectrum. Is that a competitive disadvantage for you at this point? And would that situation worsen with a competitor out there with that much spectrum certainly relative to its smaller subscriber base? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Okay. On the 5G Home, I think -- remember we have the limited sort of 5G Home in four markets right now and we capped both the development on our software as well on how many cities. That's how we did a proprietary solution.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">The only thing I can say, our win share is really good in those markets. It seems to be good appetite for 5G Home. We have a good performance of it. And then we're going for the second half of this year or this part of the year, we're going to come back with NR sort of 5G Home CP equipment.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And I think that what we're going to do, we need a certain size of market that -- so it makes sense for us. So I think as we said before, I mean this is the 2021 when we're going to have a significant impact on our revenue. So 2020 is going to be an important year for us and of course coming out now in the latter part of this year and starting at the markets all the time will be very important.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">On the spectrum side, I mean, I think that we always have the headwind that people don't think we have enough spectrum and all of that. I mean what this organization and this engineering team is doing with the spectrum is, I would say is magnificent.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Now remember sometimes when we talk about spectrum its so much more it is softer how you plan, how you build the network, how you get utilization out of it? And I think that -- that the team has done very good all the time.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">As I said previously, we have a very compelling position when it comes to millimeter wave for ultra wideband, but we also have spectrum where we can deploy 5G in the other bands ultimately 5G is going to be on all bands. And I have a high confidence that my team is going to be doing that well continue to have the leadership in the market when it comes to network performance. There might also come up opportunities all the time where it could be added spectrum. But right now to launch both capacity and coverage, we feel confident on the assets we have.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">John Hodulik</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thanks, John. Hey, Brett, we’re ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. The next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Jennifer Fritzsche</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I may, I just wanted to revisit on the fiber activity. I think you said you're now adding 1,400 miles of fiber -- route miles every month versus 1,000. Some tower companies have cited some issues with municipalities and power companies and utility. Are you finding that easier lately or harder? Because that just seems like a 40% increase monthly is a big jump.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you for the question. I would say this is not an easy work. This is really what Verizon is great at. I mean, we have people all the way from working with the municipalities, working with engineering, planning, working with third parties. And remember in the couple of years since we decided to invest together with warning in the fiber factory, we have come to actually around 1,400 route miles a month.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So yes you're right, we are scaling right now and the team is really, really responding to the demands we have on them. We're always going to have even higher internal demands on them, but as you can see we definitely have a good role right now, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to do it. But I think we have put the machine in place with a team that I have lot of confidence into it.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jennifer Fritzsche</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And Hans if I may, should we continue to see that number increase throughout the year as you gain more scale?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Not so much. I think we start to getting on the volumes we are and that's really important on the stand, because there has been questions on market, the CapEx will go up and all of that. Remember we are almost on the higher volume where we believe we need to be in order to serve this market, because there are of course technicalities of doing it. So I think we have a machine right now that is actually executing very well on the high volume. There might be some increases but maybe not so much more. I think now it's more about the broad deployment in all of these markets where we are right now deploying fiber.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jennifer Fritzsche</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Terrific. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Jennifer. Hey, Brett, we’re ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Rollins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi thanks. Couple of questions. First, has there been any recent changes to the cable MVNO deal? And how do you see your role continuing to evolve as a wholesaler of capacity in the industry?</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then secondly is there an update on any of the potential strategic moves you could make on the wireline side, whether it's asset optimization or trying to figure out maybe how to proceed in the video business with the current size that you have? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Okay. Thank you. On the MVNO side, no, there are no major differences but the important is that, we believe its good model. Remember we outlined our network-to-service strategy where we -- sometimes we're doing the connectivity and then we have others being on top of this in MVNO, sometimes we do the connectivity to platforms and in some cases we do the whole strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">So I think that that continues to be important for us and we're happy with our partnership with the cable MVNO which is part of how we are actually doing a month usage of our assets, getting maximum utilization of the investments we're doing. So for us this is playing straight into the long-term goals as we have as a company.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">On the wireline optimization, we -- I would say that the biggest assets we have here is of course all the infrastructure we have, but also the customer relations we have and we are working. Of course we are looking into all the areas we need to fortify or all the areas we should drop which was the market is not demanding. And I think that's a very normal way of reviewing the strategy all the time.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And Tammy and the team is now in place for this quarter, they are confident talking to the customer what we need to do and where we need to fortify in some areas where the products maybe around heating. But is no major, it is just the daily grinding that you do in order to optimize, how you work with your customers and how you optimize your capital and efficiency.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I can also add of course that, in this quarter we announced and that we're going to work with YouTube TV when it comes to the sort of the linear TV both for the Fios optionality as well as for the wireless customers. So again, working with the model that we outlined in February and just continue with that.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Rollins</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thanks, Mike. Hey, Brett, ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Moffett</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, hi. Hans, I wonder, if we could go back to the spectrum question for a second. I understand that the longer term spectrum position for 5G, you have a lot of spectrum bands outside of millimeter wave.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">But there's been a lot of concern in the market of late that for the near term your coverage map may be more limited than your competitors, until you can start peeling away some of your LTE and 3G committed spectrum bands and dedicate them.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Can you just talk about that issue? And how you think about the coverage layer of 5G over the next few years as you make the transition?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">No, that's a great question. I think first of all DSS which is Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is the same for all and that's a standard solution coming out in the market software. So I think that we're not disadvantage -- anyone if you want to deploy your coverage and I think that's how we are on.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">At the same time you also want to see that there's enough handsets things out in the market when you start turning on 5G, so you get because we want to do a transformative feeling of over 5Gs. We don't want to rebrand them and say it's 5G and you don't feel a difference. We already have the best 4G network and for us the customer is the most important.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So you're right. I mean I see that we will have a coverage map whenever it's going to be needed for our customers and is going to be enough handsets in the market and not disadvantage for anything. So I think that historically we have had those feedbacks that we are not in the right position with spectrum etcetera.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">I come from the outside. I worked and saying what Verizon has done with spectrum and with new software’s and with the optimizing, how you build the networks and I'm confident that we have a good path here. I'm not feeling that we're disadvantaged. I feel that we're executing right now, we're launching markets where others are doing other things. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Moffett</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Is there any concern that even from a marketing messaging perspective though that your competitors will have more ink on the map so to speak early on in 5G even if the experience in 5G may not be all that much better than your 4G networks?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Let's see how that turns out. Because again there’s a lot of promises. I think that Verizon has had and I actually inherited a fantastic DNA in this company that we first do the things and then we start marketing it. And I think that's what we will continue to do. Other might have other strategy, so I'm not going into that contest about who is talking most right now.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">I'm working with a technology, myself weekly to see that we are doing this right for our customers and that's a consumer, it's an enterprise customer, it's a governmental customers, it’s an IoT customers. We think it through and that’s why we build the Intelligent Edge Network already and started two years ago.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">And I think that the significance of understanding, how important that is for the success of Verizon, I think has not really been understood yet. And we will just continue to execute on that. But there's going to be a lot of message in the market and you know it as well. Just be confident that our company, Verizon will continue to execute on the real 5G with eight currencies and seeing that we can actually give the right performance to all our customers in the right moment. </p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Moffett</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks, Hans.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yeah. Thanks, Craig.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Craig Moffett</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hey, Brett, we’re ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thank you. The next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Colby Synesael</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Great. Two questions if I may. First for Matt, I was hoping you could quantify the cost of the VSP plan that was implemented in the second quarter. Since that didn't seem to have an impact on free cash flow? And then secondly if you're able to just quantify the savings you could expect from that as we go into the third quarter?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And then my second question has to do with the fiber out miles you're referencing on the call. I just wanted to separate the conversation between the route miles and small cells. So I appreciate your adding about 1,400 miles, route miles per month in the second quarter. But are you seeing the same momentum in terms of actually getting the small cells put up as well? Because I feel like you could still be adding the fiber route miles, but not necessarily getting the actual small cells up and seems like those two things would have to go hand-in-hand and that might explain why some of other companies that are out there doing the same thing might be seeing the lease on the small cell side? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I can start with the fiber and Matt will on start on the other one. So the fiber, remember it's a multiuse fiber and I have several different customers. I have the network guys that need this for 4G and 5G, I have the enterprise, I have the small and medium, and I have wholesale. And that's, of course, very important when we build that we can have owner economics on fiber and we can build it as we had all those customers.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">But, of course, initially quite a lot of the fiber is coming and going to the small cells and that's why we are able to turn up the 2019, as we have done so far. But again, the question earlier was about how much we are now actually gaining on it.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">I think this is an early indicator about how we're building the network, because you need to start with the fiber and getting the permits in the cities before you can deploy the 5G. So this is early indications that we have a high speed and organization to be prepared for the 5G. And whatever our use cases we have for fiber. Matt?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah. So, Colby, on the voluntary separation, yeah, obviously, the income statement charges we took in the fourth quarter of last year from a cash flow standpoint, we took but the largest piece was in the first quarter and then some in 2Q and 3Q. Certainly I think that there's good savings in the first half of the year. We mentioned like $418 million of positive impact in the first half of the year and we'll have another step-up in 3Q as the final tranche of employees came off payroll at the end of June.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So for the full year, I expect that to be north of $1 billion of impact and that benefit on a year-over-year basis will carry over into the first half of next year until we get to a full run rate by June of next year. So certainly being a positive thing is part of our overall focus on improvement the cost efficiency of the business and we will continue to focus on that. We're well on-track to more than meet the $10 billion commitment we made and the VSP was a big component of that.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Colby Synesael</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yeah, thanks, Colby. Hey, Brett, we are ready for the next question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. The next question comes from Mike McCormack of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike McCormack</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Hey, thanks guys. Hans maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing at robust subscriber estimate business segment for wireless. What you're seeing from a competitive standpoint in the B2B marketplace?</p>, <p class=""p p13"">I know one of your competitors is pretty loud about getting bigger there. And just thinking about the ARPA drivers going forward, what do you see there? Obviously you have more route to move to Unlimited. Any other puts and takes of ARPUs should be thinking about the back half? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. On the business side when it comes to wireless we are taking share. We feel really good about it. I think that Tam and the team are doing a great job with relationship that we had of course the network quality we have, it is very important for businesses. I mean there's no doubt about that coverage and capacity becomes even more important and there's no enterprise company there has not been a bigger to transformation. So I'm pleased with that we want to do even more. So yes.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">The second question was about the ARPA. I will hand it over to Matt. But I can also say that, a team with Ronan, especially on the consumer side has been since Unlimited would launch continue to lean forward with new offerings with new ways of dealing with the market segmenting and up and actually continue to have good service revenue role.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And I think that's what I'm pleased with and I look at the team. I know that they have more call up the sleeves so they say. So what Matt and I are doing together we're transforming the company to have a decent term to closer that to be prepared for that marketplace to continue to do well. So I feel good about Ronan and what his team is doing. Matt?</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. Thanks Hans. So Mike as you think about wireless as a whole in your office trajectory, it's coming from the overall growth of the business. Just a few things to point out that's really driving both ARPA and obviously the total service revenue being the B2B space which have very strong results in the quarter, while the consumer space which also performed well.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">Net account growth positive in second quarter of this year, that's up year-over-year so a good growth there. We continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds yet again a number of quarters in a row that we've done that. And in addition to leading the industry in gross adds, growing year-over-year and not – that’s something that not all industry participants can say that they did.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">So leading the industry in gross adds also leading the industry in phone churn, yet again. The net result there is phone net adds of 245,000 a nice increase over the 199,000 last year. So as I think about the business in the first half of the year, we had nice strong performance that went from the operational side on to the financials as well, puts us in a good great place as we jump off into the second half of the year to continue that momentum, and feel good about where we are at this point in time.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Mike McCormack</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Great. Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yeah. Thanks, Mike.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Brady Connor</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yeah. Hey, Brett, we have time for one last question.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thank you. Your last question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Thanks so much. Just a couple on wireless competition. So Hans, obviously, a strong wireless quarter. I'm curious if you're seeing any competitive impact from the first set initiative at AT&amp;T. I know, I think you recently signed a deal with the Massachusetts first responder. I'm not sure if that’s sign of competition going back and forth.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And then I was just hoping to revisit, bundling and the importance of video to wireless with AT&amp;T planning to bundle HBO Max when the launch it next spring with wireless services. Is bundling video with wireless, is it a lower churn, or is it just necessary to compete on the promotional basis with others that are offering video. I'm just sort of curious how that informs your video strategy? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Hans Vestberg</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Yes. So you need to speak a little bit when we talk about the consumer and business. But let me just say, I mean if I look in the second quarter it was a little bit more competitive than the first quarter when it comes to competition in the market and that tells a lot about our performance that we gained all those net additions at the same time we had the low churn.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">And so I think that on the business side, as I said before, we are -- we're doing well on the business side and again I think that the wireless part of the business side is important than the network performance ease of critical essence, the coverage and the performance. But, of course, there's competition for those deals as well. I think we're doing well in that area and we will continue to do well.</p>, <p class=""p p14"">We have new offerings coming out and we'll continue to build the network even more robust and getting more quality on it. So again I think the team is there, Matt and I are working with transformation of the company to enable after continue to compete and do well in the market and even both Tami, I would say and Ronan are the sort of tools to work in the market. And that's what we're doing. And I think we're done it well in this quarter and preparing for the rest of the year.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""answer"">Matt Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Just one follow-up on the video question there. Look we're very confident with – the most important thing to customers and wireless is the quality of the network experience. And so for the past couple of years now, we're seeing competitors bundled video offerings in with wireless and we continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds and we continue to lead the industry in churn. So I think that demonstrates the most important thing to customer is the quality of that connection, the reliability of that connection and that when you have the best network, you don't need to bundle other things in there in the same way and we'll continue to be focused on providing the best quality network out there.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong><span class=""question"">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Great. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Brady Connor</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thanks, Doug. Hey, Brett, that's all the time we have right now. Before we end the call, I'd like to hand it over to Hans for some closing comments.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Hans Vestberg</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Thank you, Brady. I think we've covered quite a lot of ground in this call, because basically question has range for all our business. But here's just a couple of things. First of all, I'm really proud of the team, what they’ve achieved. And remember we have change the structure, we have changed how we build a network, we have done large voluntary program. We're reporting in a new structure, we're putting new structure and team is executing well.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">I think that's the way we want to work here, continue to lead the market and continue transform to be a strong company with a strategy we set out in February.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">So that then comes back to execution on fundamentals. That's what we're doing and will continue to do so to be disciplined on our capital, also continue to lead to market. And then of course I think a lot of questions are circulating around the 5G what we laid out in the February, Capital Markets Day is still valid and that's what we're aiming for and we are executing on and I think that the team is doing a great job there.</p>, <p class=""p p15"">So I think that to sum it up. I'm proud of the quarter and the changes that we're doing at the same time delivering this quarter so -- and financial earnings. So thank you very much for attending this call. And I guess I'll see you out there soon.</p>, <p class=""p p15""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p15"">Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect.</p>]"

This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC’s website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and the reconciliation are available in today’s earnings release.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Now, let me turn the call over to Al.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Al Kelly</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Mike, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">It is clear from our strong results today that the business continues to perform well as we simultaneously invest to deliver growth in the medium to long term. Given that it was a busy quarter, I’m going to streamline my comments on the business performance and only offer a few headlines; then, I’ll discuss how we are enhancing our capabilities through our recent acquisitions and investments; and finally, I’ll review our progress in building partnerships around the globe with FinTechs as well as our traditional clients.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">So, let’s start with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was better than expected at 11% or 13% on a constant dollar basis. Payments volume growth was 9% on a constant dollar basis or almost 10% excluding China, which continued to be impacted by some runoff of our dual branded cards that captured domestic volumes and had limited impact on our revenue. Cross border growth rebounded up 3 points from last quarter and client incentives were lower than anticipated.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%. Adjusted expense growth was 10%, reflecting marketing investments, the impact of the new revenue accounting standard, and a number of nonrecurring items. And adjusted EPS growth was 14%, lapping a low adjusted tax rate of 18% last year. Vasant will share more details in his remarks.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">As we look ahead to the future, we’re pursuing our strategy by A, investing in growing and enhancing our network, including capturing new payment flows, building out our acceptance footprint and expanding our base of clients. We’re building our arsenal of value-added capabilities that could be components on our network or on other networks, what we call network-agnostic, and see we’re fortifying key bedrock pillars of the business, talent, technology, security, and the brand.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Against this backdrop, this quarter, we announced several strategic acquisitions and investments that will accelerate our progress in capturing new payment flows and extend the boundaries of our capabilities and our network.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">First, we assume control of Earthport in early May and are pleased to say that as of July 4th, we’ve obtained full legal ownership. Earthport provides cross-border payment services via network that connects with local ACH system with direct connections in 88 countries. Before Earthport, through our Visa Direct capabilities, our debit credentials and ATM network, Visa could reach about half of the bank accounts. With Earthport, we’ve become a network of networks and have extended reach to over 99% of bank accounts in the 88 countries including the top 50 markets.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Our integration efforts are well underway and we are actively working to launch our first, fully integrated experience, prior to the calendar year-end, which will provide a single connection for clients to push funds to cards via VisaNet and bank accounts via Earthport.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Also in the quarter, we announced the acquisitions of Verifi and tokenization business from Rambus, which will help us in our development of network agnostic services, and will be integrated with our existing suite of tokenization, fraud management and risk solutions. This tokenization acquisition will enable Visa to extend the security and convenience of tokenization to all types of transactions including the ability to support domestic card network, account-based and real-time payment systems. Before this acquisition, Visa could turn a 16-digit Visa credential into a token, but now we can tokenize a bank account, a domestic card network credential or a ticket.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Verifi’s best in class dispute resolution tools enable issuers to connect with merchant’s data immediately, when a consumer calls to dispute a transaction, so that the issue is settled within one phone call. Verifi is the industry leader with 25,000 merchant connections helping to decrease the time spent on resolution, while at the same time decreasing the percentage of chargebacks. Verifi adds to existing Visa tools, which are aimed at reducing customer friction across the entire payment experience.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Last week, we announced the acquisition of Payworks, a point of sale software solution, which enables acquirers to support merchant terminal payments via the cloud. This enables merchants to seamlessly and quickly implement new functionalities such as adding new payment types, thereby creating better customer experiences and lower merchant operating costs.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Payworks will add in-store payment processing to CyberSource’s InComm ecommerce payments platform to create a fully integrated omnichannel payment acceptance solution. As part of CyberSource’s solution to acquire, these capabilities will be white label to drive more innovation in the payments ecosystem.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Across Southeast Asia, we have partnered with and invested in Gojek, a ride-hailing service that has become a mobile Super Approximately, featuring over 18 different verticals spanning payments, delivery, laundry cleaning, tickets and more. To give you a sense of the magnitude of Gojek, they have 108 million app downloads and half have been used in the payment service, GoPay. We’re working together to make digital payments easier for both GoPay and Visa users while expanding to new use cases.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">In the B2B space, we recently announced an investment in PayMate, a leading B2B payments FinTech in India who we have been partnering with in India and our CEMEA region since last year. PayMate operates a portal, connecting 35,000 buyers and suppliers to provide buyers with a consolidated view of their accounts payable across all payment types. Through the use of Visa credentials, buyers and suppliers have access to better reconciliation data.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our partnership and investment seek to drive incremental volume to our network by helping big and small businesses bring more efficiencies to their payment processes as well as transition from cash and checks to digital payments via a Visa credential.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Visa Direct continues to deliver transaction growth of over 100% and opens up opportunities for additional payment flows. In the U.S. alone, over the last 12 months, more than 60 million Visa credentials have sent or received funds via Visa Direct, 75% of which have completed more than one transaction using Visa credentials. About 70% of these users have received funds which can drive additional spend in our C2B.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In cross-border remittance, we’ve announced a new strategic relationship with Western Union. Western Union adds to our growing list of partners in this area, including MoneyGram, Remitly and EMQ, allowing their customers to make cost-effective cross-border payments through Visa credential with speed, convenience and transparency.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">In addition to cross-border remittance, Visa Direct has also grown in the insurance disbursement space. Today 5 of the top 10 insurance companies in the United States either are using or in the process of enabling Visa Direct to facilitate quick and secure claims payout to their customers. In Europe, we recently added our first insurance use case with Insurance-as-a-Service provider Setoo in partnership with SafeCharge, a global payment service provider.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Another disbursement use case that is gaining traction is small business merchant settlement, which allows acquirers to transfer funds in real time at the request of the merchant, helping with cash flow needs of small businesses. Visa Direct is enabling the recent launch of Instant Transfer by PayPal in Canada, in addition to the United States for same-day settlements to small businesses and individual consumers. As we continue to drive new and existing payment flows, we remain focused on providing exemplary user experiences to ensure that Visa remains the preferred way to pay.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Tap to pay significantly improves the point-of-sale experience, and consumers are adopting it quickly. This quarter outside the United States tap to pay surpassed 50% of face-to-face transactions that run over our network, up from less than 30% just three years ago. There are now almost 50 countries where contactless is at least a third of all face-to-face transactions, up from 35 countries at the end of last fiscal year in September. We know that when contactless is introduced to a market, it increases the number of transactions For instance, this past quarter, while UK payments volume grew in the low to mid single digit, processed transactions grew much faster in the double digits. Transaction growth was 2.5 times the rate of payments volume growth and consumers made more small dollar tap to pay transactions with their Visa card instead of cash. Canada has also seen a similar dynamic. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">In the United States, we’re well underway to reaching 100 million tap to pay Visa cards in force by the end of 2019, and early adoption is similar to what we’ve seen in other successful tap to pay markets. We expect to surpass 3 million Visa cards by the end of 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">As we discussed previously, transit continues to be one of the best ways to habituate the use of tap to pay. The New York MTA launched an open loop payments -- a pilot on May 31st in a limited number of stations as part of an 18-month rollout and the results to-date have been very encouraging.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Other areas where we’re making progress to improve the user experience include tokenization, secure remote commerce, and the installation payment solution we are piloting. All of these enhancements reflect a fundamental truth that is simple, consistent, secure and frictionless user experience leads to incremental volume and transactions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We know that it takes strong partnerships across the ecosystems to deliver these great user experiences. Therefore, we are actively listening to client and customers’ needs, and working to support their success. Partnerships are not simply additive to our business model, they are fundamental to our business model, whether it’d be our traditional financial institutions or FinTechs.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">And on FinTechs, they continue to be key enablers around the world and helping to expand access to electronic payments and opening up new acceptance. And these are the natural partner because we bring global scale, a recognizable brand, security, reliability, and sophisticated capability.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">This quarter was no exception in our ability to develop partnerships with FinTechs. So, I’d like to highlight a few. In India, we launched a co-brand credit card with the largest cab app aggregator, Ola Cabs; and SBI Card, the second largest credit card issuer in the country. With a simplified application process and a seamless card management through their app, this product will offer a rich reward proposition across all those 150 million users.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Across Asia Pacific, we’ve partnered with Razer, a global lifestyle brand for gamers with 60 million users to offer a prepaid credential in the Razer Pay e-wallet. In Latin America, Rappi, a leading on-demand delivery platform is now using Visa debit card as the preferred way for its customers to pay in Colombia, Mexico, and soon also in Brazil. They’ve also implemented CyberSource solutions across their seven operating markets to drive more secure and seamless transactions. Rappi currently has more than 20 million registered users and 90,000 delivery drivers who fulfill close to 5 million orders a month.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Turkey, we partnered with one of the largest FinTech, ininal, in an effort to reach the 40% of the Turkish population that is unbanked with the launch of a nationwide program for general purpose, reloadable Visa prepaid card.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We’re also excited about the opportunities these new partnerships could bring for sure, but we also continue to build deepen relationships with our more traditional merchants and issuers, and I will call out four this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Europe, we renewed the credit and commercial portfolios with Bank Leumi, the largest bank in Israel; and Crédit Mutuel, one of the largest issuers in France. Across Europe, our deal volume and win rate is significantly higher on a year-to-year basis -- year-over-year basis.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In Brazil, we teamed up with Itau and MercadoLibre to launch a contactless cobranded card targeting MercadoLibre consumers with installment capability and a unique app for managing loyalty points. MercadoLibre has 38 million buyers in Latin America and Brazil, representing 60% of their marketplace’s volume.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">In the United States, we’re pleased to announce that we have extended our longstanding partnership with JPMorgan Chase through the end of 2029. This long-term extension will enable us to work together to accelerate the growth of electronic payments, deliver enhanced payment experiences, such as our recent collaborations to enable tap to pay in the New York City subway system. Additionally, we work together to support and innovate our world-class co-brand partners and to further extent into the commercial space with B2B solutions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Our pipeline of partnerships is robust, and we expect to sign several other significant renewals and new deals in the remainder of this fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">So, in summary, it was an exciting quarter for Visa with strong results, strategic acquisitions and growth in partnerships. As we look ahead, our focus continues to be expanding our network with a wide variety of new payment flows and acceptance options; growing our value-added services portfolio to enhance all networks, not just Visa’s; investing in foundational elements that make Visa a world class partner, superior talent, innovative and reliable technology, unmatched security and a powerful brand. We remain open minded, innovative and flexible to meet the needs of the growing ecosystem in a rapidly evolving payments landscape as we’re committed to our goal to be the best way to pay and be paid to everyone everywhere.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, let me turn it over to Vasant.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Vasant Prabhu</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you, Al.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Despite strong currency headwinds, our business trends accelerated in the third quarter, as net revenue and EPS growth were both higher than expected. Net revenue grew over 11% on a nominal dollar basis and over 13% in constant dollars, while adjusted EPS grew 14% in nominal dollars and approximately 18% on a constant dollar basis. Through three quarters of fiscal 2019, net revenue is up 11% and adjusted EPS up 17% in nominal dollars, and over 12% and 19%, respectively, in constant dollars.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">A few highlights: Growth across all key business drivers, payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume accelerated from last quarter. Payments volume growth in constant dollars improved to 9%. Global constant dollar growth excluding China and the UK was over 10%. Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual valid cards, which have minimal revenue impact. The UK economy remains weak due to Brexit uncertainty; ex-UK global payments volume trends remain robust.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%, primarily due to faster U.S. growth and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina. Adjusting for cross-border volume within Europe, constant dollar cross-border growth was 9%, up almost 4 points from last quarter, exceeding our expectations. As a reminder, cross-border volume within Europe has revenue yields similar to Europe domestic volumes and continues to be impacted by e-commerce platform, reorienting within the EU. Growth was consistently strong each month after factoring Easter timing in April, and the improvement from last quarter was broad based.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Every region’s outbound growth improved by at least 1 point, mostly benefiting Europe and U.S. inbound volume. Net revenue growth was 11.4%, despite 2 points of exchange rate drag and the lowest currency volatility we’ve seen in five years. Growth was helped by stronger cross-border momentum and lower client incentives than expected. The impact of pricing was higher than last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Client incentives were better-than-expected due to lower incentives for some deals and program than we had estimated, lower volumes in some markets and some deal delays. At this point, we have a very robust pipeline of significant renewals and new deals that we expect to get done by the end of our fiscal year.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We have closed on Earthport and Payworks as well as signed definitive agreements to acquire two other companies. These acquisitions significantly enhance our capabilities, extending our reach to over 99% of global bank accounts in 88 markets, facilitating tokenization of all types of transactions beyond our own, streamlining dispute resolution and enabling omnichannel payment processing through CyberSource. We expect all these acquisitions to close before the end of the year. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">We also added significant new partners, like Gojek, MercadoLibre and Ola Cabs while renewing our enduring partnership with JPMorgan Chase through 2029. We repurchased 12.9 million shares of stock-based common stock at an average price of one $163.59 for $2.1 billion in the first fiscal quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Now, some details on our key business drivers. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated to 9%, credit was up 7%, debit was up 11%. Growth remained strong in most parts of the world with CEMEA growing 22%, Latin America 16%, Asia Pacific excluding China, growing almost 10% and Europe excluding the UK, growing 12%.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, up 1 point from last quarter. The improvement was driven by the timing of Easter as well as higher consumer credit growth. Fuel prices were ultimately a drag on growth in the quarter as the strong start in April faded in May and June. Double-digit growth was sustained in debit at 11% with Visa Direct contribution similar to last quarter. Credit grew 7% as the impact of the Cabela’s conversion continued and we start to lap commercial card wins from last year.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 9%, growth in CEMEA remained robust at 22% with strong momentum across Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America growth accelerated 2 percentage points to 16%, driven by improvements in Brazil and Mexico. Growth in the UK remained weak. However, growth in the rest of Europe accelerated to 12% with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe. Asia Pacific growth excluding China was almost 10%, in line with last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Processed transaction growth of 12% is up 1 point from last quarter. Growth in the U.S. accelerated almost 1 point, in line with volumes. Also helping growth was a processing gain in Argentina, which had a full quarter impact. Growth improved in Brazil and was stable in Europe, Asia Pacific and CEMEA. After getting off to a strong start in April, mostly due to Easter timing, cross-border volume growth remained healthy through the quarter, resulting in 7% growth on a constant dollar basis, up 3 points from last quarter. Constant dollar growth adjusted for cross-border volume within Europe was 9%, up 4 points from last quarter with strength across both travel-related online spending. Of the 4-point improvement, approximately 1 point was driven by the lack of cryptocurrency drag that impacted each of the past two quarters due to the spike in cryptocurrency purchases in late 2017 and early 2018. Another couple of points was driven by broad-based spend increases. Outbound commerce accelerated from Canada, Japan, Australia and across most of Latin America and our CEMEA region. Europe was the biggest beneficiary of inbound commerce with growth in the mid-teens.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Moving on to a quick summary of third quarter financial results. Net revenue grew at a better than expected 11.4%, driven by higher processed transaction and cross-border volume growth as well as lower client incentives. This growth rate includes a 2-point headwind from exchange rate shift and a sizable drag from low currency volatility. The adoption of ASC-606 lifted revenue by approximately 1.5 points. Service revenue grew 10%, benefiting from pricing. Data processing revenues were up 13%. International revenue increased 8% with pricing actions and a favorable country mix, i.e., slower growth within Europe being significantly offset by lower currency volatility. Other revenue grew 49%, a little over half of which is driven by the adoption of ASC-606 and the remainder a result of clients increasingly utilizing our value-added service capabilities.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 20.9% were lower than we expected this quarter due to lower incentives for some deals and programs, some deal delays, and lower volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the fourth quarter, based on the deals just completed in the third quarter and the current pipeline of significant new deals and renewals expected to be signed in Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Operating expenses declined 18% on a GAAP basis due to the litigation provision last year associated with the interchange multi-district litigation. Excluding the special items, expenses grew 10%, primarily driven by marketing costs, a number of non-recurring expenses captured in G&amp;A and technology-related investments driving growth in network processing and depreciation expenses. Marketing expenses grew 18%, driven by investments related to the FIFA Women’s World Cup and the adoption of ASC-606.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">General and administrative expenses grew 37%, primarily due to several non-recurring items, ASC-606 impacts, and indirect taxes. The adoption of ASC-606 added approximately 2.5 points to expense growth.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Non-operating expenses were $78 million higher than last quarter, as investment gains were $9 million in the third quarter versus $84 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have recorded $89 million in investment gains or over $0.03 of EPS, largely due to the change in accounting rules. As you know, this is a non-recurring item. We continue to benefit from higher interest income on our cash balances as well as from forward contracts swapping some of our U.S. dollar debt to euro-denominated debt, which reduces our interest expense.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year 2019. First, let me share our business driver growth for the first three weeks of July, which are relatively consistent with the third quarter. Through July 21st, U.S. payments volume growth was 8% with U.S. credit growing 7% and debit over 9%. Processed transactions grew 11%, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8% or over 9% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Our fourth quarter outlook assumes growth trends across our key business drivers, in line with what we experienced in the third quarter. The exchange rate drag is expected to ease to 1.5 points on net revenues. Currency volatility will likely remain a significant headwind. The impact of pricing will be higher than Q3. Based on our current deal pipeline and the recognition of deals signed in this quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to be 1.5 to 2 points higher than Q3. When you put all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth to be moderately better than the third quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">On the expense front, we continue to invest in our growth programs. Fourth quarter expense growth is likely to be in the mid to high single digit range. The fourth quarter will include a full quarter of expenses including integration costs and purchase accounting for Earthport and for Payworks, which closed last week. The exchange rate drag on EPS will ease to 2 points. We expect the acquisitions of Verifi and the tokenization business of Rambus to close during our fourth quarter. Depending on timing, they could add a small amount of revenue and 1 point to 2 points to our expense growth. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will quantify the revenue and EPS impact of all four acquisitions.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">We are updating our full-year fiscal year 2019 outlook, on net revenue growth, low double digits on a nominal basis with approximately 1.5 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact and over 1 percentage point of positive impact from the new revenue accounting standard. The change in the ASC-606 impact is driven by deals that were not anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the 21.5% to 22% range; expense growth in the low single digit decrease on a GAAP basis; and an approximately 10% increase adjusted for special items in fiscal 2018, including approximately 2.5 percentage-point increase from the new revenue accounting standard; effective tax rate in the 19.5% to 20% range; EPS growth low 20s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis, and mid to high teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, including approximately 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. We have several acquisitions that will be completed this year. As I mentioned earlier, we will quantify for you the revenue and EPS impact inclusive of integration costs and purchase accounting on our fourth quarter results. We will also give you our best estimates for the revenue and EPS impact of these acquisitions on fiscal year 2020 when we provide our 2020 outlook in October.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">In summary, business momentum accelerated in the third quarter. We exceeded our revenue and EPS expectations, despite strong headwinds from currencies. More importantly, we are substantially enhancing our capabilities through four acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and significant renewals of longstanding relationships with several key renewals and new deals to be executed in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest at a healthy clip to drive long-term growth and capture the extraordinary opportunities available to us to drive payments digitization globally.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">With that, I’ll turn this back to Mike.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Mike Milotich</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">We are now ready to take questions, Jordan.</p>, <p class=""p p8"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Jim Schneider</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on the extension of the JPMorgan partnership. Whether there is any substantial change in the terms of that agreement outside of the length and in terms of the scope, anything that would show up in the economics of the business going forward? Any color around that would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks, Jim. We’re obviously not going to discuss the details of it. I think, both companies are very satisfied with it. JPMorgan is a big and sophisticated issuer. And I think as I talked to the senior leadership team there, we thought it was a good idea to renew our deal and kind of focus on all the various things that are happening in payments and make sure that we weren’t distracted by a negotiation that would happen over the next year or two. I’m not going to add much more color than that.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Darrin Peller</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Thanks, guys. Look, it’s great to hear the momentum in the pipeline on the wins and renewals, including obviously the JPM deal. It sounded like you were saying out that the win rate, especially in Europe, is stronger than before. And I guess, first of all, is there anything that’s changed in terms of why you think you are winning at this rate? Is it actually better than it was before? And then, maybe just comment on even in the back of that how rebates and incentives, the guide is actually a little bit lower than it was before, despite these renewals in this pipeline? Thanks, guys.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I’d say a couple of things, and I’ll let Vasant talk a little bit about the incentive. First of all, in Europe, we’re now on our front foot. We are past the integration. We’ve got our management team in place. We’re not all the way there, but we’ve been moving more resources into the markets. And we’ve been able to focus much more on running a very good commercial organization in Europe. And I think that it really is starting to pay dividends to be able to be not distracted by any of the integration activities.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">I think, the second thing that’s happening in Europe but is also happening around the world is that we’ve gotten our act together as it relates to FinTechs. I’d be the first to admit, I think we were a little bit slow out of the chute a year and a half ago. But over the last five quarters or so, we’ve been very, very focused on FinTechs and making sure that we are easy to do business with, easy to integrate with, easy to get on-boarded. And I think that FinTechs appreciate the various assets that Visa brings to the table from our global reach to our fabulous brand to a lot of our experience and capabilities and our scale.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So, I think that those would be the two big factors that would come to mind for me when I think about your question about what is different recently. I don’t know if Vasant wants to add to that or certainly talk about the client incentives.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Vasant Prabhu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I think on the client incentives front, there is a variety of reasons why they’re running lower than we might have expected. Several items that are good things where some -- we make estimates on the terms under which deals might be renewed, and in some cases we haven’t had to use up the incentives we thought we might have needed to when we sort of gave you a general view of things. So that’s a good thing and that is actually permanent and continues. Secondly, volumes have been lower in some parts of the world and that does lead to lower incentives. Thirdly, exchange rates that impact the gross revenue line, as you know, help the incentive lines. So, to some degree that is reflected also when you do a year-over-year comparison. And then, as it relates to the wins, which we’re very -- as we said, we’re very happy about what has already happened, but we also have a very robust pipeline, many of which we will be able to tell you about next quarter, and a lot of that is incorporated into our outlook for the fourth quarter. Those wins, they play out over time. The volume comes in over time and the incentives will play out over time. So, you won’t see the impacts right away. So, those are some of the reasons.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And in terms of sort of the activity now and the things and their contribution to volume, as you know conversions take time, they play out over time. So, the volume will sort of layer in over a year or two. So, you won’t see the full impact for at least a couple of years from things that we are winning right now.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Lisa Ellis</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Hi. Good morning, guys. Question about the strategy, Al, that you talked about with the acquisitions of Earthport and Rambus, and some of the other organic investments. You’ve highlighted that you are adding more of these network of network type of services that extend beyond the boundaries of VisaNet. Can you just talk a bit about this strategy more broadly, meaning like what market opportunity specifically are you going after, and is this sort of ancillary to the core business or do you expect it to become more core over time? And then, finally, how do you think about maintaining the quality of the Visa network and brand, as you sort of extend and expand into the sort of network of network model?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thanks, Lisa. So, today, we process about three quarters of the transactions that have the Visa brand on the credential being used, whether it’s a virtual credential or a real card. We recognize that there are other situations where we may not be able to process, whether it’s a real-time payment network that a country decides to build out or a domestic card network, payments network that somebody decides to build out. And when we look at those kinds of networks, we see a lack of sophistication in some of the capabilities. And we believe that we have an opportunity to take our toolbox of capabilities and provide additional value to those networks, either on a licensing type basis or pay-as-you-go type basis. And I see it as very additive to our ability to grow the Company and grow revenue and be involved in as many transactions in some way, shape or form as we possibly can. In no way are we stepping back from continuing to invest in VisaNet. It is a very important asset for us. And we have a number of projects ongoing right now. And we will continue to make sure that VisaNet is the best possible network in the world in terms of capabilities and in terms of security and in terms of reliability, all of which are very, very important.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Vasant Prabhu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. I mean, if you look at each of these -- you look at Verifi, it clearly enhances our network because we can streamline dispute resolution on our network, but it’s also network agnostic. And therefore, we can help other networks also provide or streamline dispute resolution. And it not only takes a lot of the time and cost out of it, but is a much better consumer experience. So, there’s value, both to our network as well as the ability to go beyond our network.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">If you look at Earthport, clearly that allows us to substantially enhance our reach. And to the extent that a portion of how we get the money from point A to point B might not be on our network, does not mean that it isn’t a Visa-branded transaction with all the security reliability et cetera that our brand offers. And so, it allows us to be a network agnostic where it makes sense to be network agnostic in the interest of serving our customers.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">And then, if you go to Payworks, CyberSource now has a substantially enhanced capability to serve what is an incredibly high demand, which is merchants’ desire to approach their business in a omnichannel kind of way where they can see the customer at the same time between both their online business and their in-store business. So, in every case, it enhances an existing business, but it also allows in every case the opportunity to extend our business beyond, let’s say, our proprietary network.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Next question?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Bryan Keane</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Al, just wanted to ask on Facebook’s Libra. There is some confusion in the market on how to think about that. Is it a strategic partner for Visa or a potential disruptive threat? Just curious your thoughts and level of expected Visa involvement in Facebook Libra.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">So, Bryan, the first thing I’d say, I think it’s important to understand the facts here and not any of us get out ahead of ourselves. So, we have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra. We’re one of, I think it’s 27 companies that have expressed that interest. So, no one has yet officially joined. We’re in discussions, and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements. So, Bryan, in my estimation, it’s really, really early days, and there’s just a tremendous amount to be finalized. But obviously, given that we’ve expressed interest, we actually believe we could be additive and helpful in the association.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Tien-Tsin Huang</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you so much. Good to see the revenue acceleration. I wanted to ask also on M&amp;A. So, you stepped up the number of deals, you said four. I think you did last year one deal. So, I’m just curious, is the appetite for Visa to do more deals going forward. I’m just curious if this is the maybe the new norm for deal activity. And separately, I just want to clarify, maybe with you, Vasant. Aside from FX accounting and the 606 accounting change and also tax, what’s changed in your outlook, if you were to adjust for those items?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Let me handle the first part and then I’ll let Vasant, Tien-Tsin, answer the question that’s directed to him. No, we have not changed our posture as it relates to M&amp;A. And the reality is, when we see an asset that we think is going to add value or bring incremental value for our clients or they are our customers or our investors, we’re going to pursue it. This quarter simply was a much busier one in terms of deals closed or deals where we reached definitive agreements.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Vasant Prabhu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">In terms of outlook, Tien-Tsin, if you look at our guidance for the full year, our net revenue growth, it’s changed -- it’s unchanged in the low double digits. The FX impact, as you saw, was about 0.5-point higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year. And the accounting impact is also 0.5-point higher roughly. So, it’s sort of a wash. So, the underlying revenue trends, low double digits and generally as good as we thought as you saw somewhat better in the third quarter. Client incentives, as you pointed out, have come down for all the reasons we talked about. Expenses, higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year; some of it is the accounting impact going up a bit; some of it is we’ve continued to invest at a healthy clip. Tax rates, slightly lower than what we expected at the start of the year. And net-net, I think our EPS is starting from the mid -- I think they were mid-teens when we started; now, we are mid to high teens. Other than the fact that the cross-border business started the year softer than we expected but has picked up well, the other big thing that has sort of been negative is the fact that currency volatility, as I pointed out, is now running in the last quarter at the lowest levels we’ve seen in five years, and that has continued into the fourth quarter. But that’s fine. I mean, as you can see, we’ve absorbed it pretty well. If currency volatility had not been this low, clearly, our international revenue growth would have been higher. So, it did have a decent impact on our international revenue growth. But despite all that and despite the currency headwinds being as high as they’ve been, we’re delighted that our nominal dollar growth is going to be in the low double digits.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Next question?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from David Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">David Koning</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks. And I guess on days, I know, Q2 was a little light with Easter and processing days timing end of the quarter, Q3 picked up a little, and I think Q4 you actually get maybe another extra day. So, what I’m wondering, you talked a little bit about U.S. decel through the first three weeks of July, and a little bit of transaction decel. But, do you actually pick back up because of the number of days in the quarter and get back to kind of more stable with fiscal Q3?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Vasant Prabhu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. In terms of processing days, the easiest way to explain it to you is, this quarter was a normal number of processing days, last quarter was below normal, and next quarter is above normal. So, you’re right, because of the way this quarter ended and next quarter is going to end, it will help us processing days wise in the way that processing days hurt us last quarter. This quarter was more normal. And as it relates to the three weeks, we always tell people three weeks don’t make a trend. I wouldn’t read too much into it. I think, our outlook is that the trends will be roughly in line with the third quarter. So, if something is slightly higher, slightly lower in the first three weeks, I don’t think it tells you much.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from our Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Harshita Rawat</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about PSD2 the implementation deadline for Strong Customer Authentication this fall. So, my question is, how your thoughts evolving, and whether the current ecosystem in Europe is ready for this deadline, and what are the long-term benefits and trade-offs of this directive could be?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Harshita, how are you? It’s -- you are absolutely right that we’ve been engaged actively with European and certain nation authorities and trade associations throughout Europe to raise awareness that we think less than half of the merchants are going to be ready by the deadline, which is September 14th when Strong Customer Authentication is supposed to get into place. We’re certainly pleased that the European Banking Authority had a recent opinion that’s going to allow for extensions as set by the local regulators. And I think that most everybody is going to largely kind of look to the -- aside from people not being in compliance. It’s our understanding that regulators in the UK and France, for example, have already communicated that they are not going enforce the September deadline. It would be very, very bad for particularly small merchants. So, there is a reluctance to move the deadline date. But I think where we’re landing is that people will look past it and allow for exceptions for some time to come.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">In the meantime, we are working with merchants and issuers as much as we can to help them make sure they will be ready. We are also working on various solutions to help identify exempt to non-exempt transactions and trying to figure out how to optimize secure customer authentication. We’ve got a Visa trusted listing capability, which allows consumers to identify merchants that frequently shop and therefore they trust them. There is a Visa delegated authorization that allows acquirers to identify merchants that already are performing strong authentication as spelled out in the regulation. So, there’s any number of things we’re doing to try to help merchants and issuers be ready. But, I think that this won’t really come to the place where people will be required until we get well into 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Ashwin Shirvaikar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Questions on B2B Connect that recently joined -- launched it globally. I know it’s early days, but I was hoping to get a couple of things answered. First, it seems you are finding now what’s looking like holistic offering, based on your organic and inorganic investments in the ecosystem. So, is that a fair assessment? And if not, what parts need to be added? And secondly, can you comment on any early traction you might be seeing in this area?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It’s just too early. We are just getting past the pilot stage. We’re talking to various banks around the world about connecting. And I just don’t expect to be able to share results probably for a good six months. I think it’s going to take that long before we really see the traction with B2B Connect. So, there is still some technical work banks would have to do, and obviously still some sales work that has to be done to make sure that people understand the capability and what it can do.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">David Togut</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Thanks. Good afternoon. Piggybacking a little bit on Ashwin’s question, all three mega mergers this year in bank tech and payments have really highlight B2B payments as an important growth objective. And of course, you’ve signed up FIS and Bottomline to B2B Connect and just closed Earthport. So, I’m curious if you could expand upon your game plan, specifically to build out distribution into the enterprise B2B market, especially for cross-border, which you’ve highlighted as a lucrative growth opportunity for Visa?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Well, I think, David, you’ve hit the nail on the head. I mean, the enterprise level volume that has traditionally been wires and check. This is going to require a whole different approach than the approach in the carded area where we rely on issuers and we rely on P-cards and corporate cards and small business cards and virtual cards, in order to be successful. In the enterprise space, you’ve got to be integrated into some of the large enterprise systems and you’ve got to build a network of partners that have the ability to generate the kinds of distribution with credibility that we need. So, we’re going to continue to look for ways to build partnerships and look at investments, like the one we made in PayMate, and one that we made earlier in BillDesk. And we’re going to continue to try to forge investments and distribution partnerships wherever we can because I think that’s going to be a key to unlocking the volume in this -- the non-carded space of B2B.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Vasant Prabhu</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes. I mean, our B2B strategy has many components and B2B Connect is one component. B2B Connect addresses, as you said, high-value transactions on a cross-border basis. Through Earthport and Visa Direct, we can address B2B transactions but low-value transactions that are high volume also on a cross-border basis. We also have initiatives that go beyond cross-border to domestic AR and AP. So, it’s a broad range of things happening on multiple fronts. I’m sure you’ve heard about our partnerships with Billtrust and so on that deal with AR. We have other partnerships that deal with AP. So, it’s a variety of initiatives on multiple fronts.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">As it relates to B2B Connect, since that was your question, we know that the value proposition is very strong. We bring settlement -- it addresses a whole bunch of pain points. We bring settlement capabilities, the security and reliability that doesn’t exist today, we utilize distributed ledger technology, and we do tokenization to substantially enhance the security of the transaction. I think, as Al said earlier, with anything like B2B Connect, you have to get the network effect going. And that means having both ends represented at scale. That takes some time to develop, which is why as Al said, you have to wait for some time as we get both sides of the network pulled together and then the volumes build. We talked about that when we talked about contactless. There are two or three years where it all builds up and then it takes off. So, it will be some time before the network effect starts working for us in B2B Connect.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Next question, please?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Dan Perlin</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to kind of just dovetail a little bit on all these discussions around these new payment flows globally. And the question is really twofold. One is, is there a need for investments, like sizable investments in the coming years to increase the scale opportunities for VisaNet? And then, secondly, Al, can you just talk a little bit about how you do think about security vulnerabilities, as you build out these networks? And your distribution points are clearly getting closer direct-to-consumer. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Dan, our new payment flows, clearly, there is always going to be investment to drive them to the level of scale that we won. I mean, in the last year plus, we’ve greatly added to the resources in Visa Direct, which are all kinds of new payment flows into the various use cases that it’s supporting. We’ve obviously built out resources in the B2B business unit as we continue to explore that space. We’ve got people. We’ve had to add people to chase down all the various wallets that are out there in the world, not all of them with financial institutions, they are with all kinds of organizations like Gojek that I talked about in my remarks. So, I think from a technical standpoint -- I’ll come to your security question in a second, from a technical standpoint, I think Visa Direct is, I’m sorry VisaNet is able to handle these various use cases today. As we get into new ones, we may have to do some augmentation of VisaNet to make sure that we can handle a new use case that we might not have anticipated. But, I think, really the bigger challenge in the bigger area where we have to invest is simply getting feet on the street and getting people out there to understand what our capabilities are and realize that we could bring various solutions to them that they might not have anticipated. And clearly with the acquisitions and the nonbinding agreements that we’ve talked about, we’ve got new capabilities that we can bring to our clients all the new around the world that we have to go communicate. So, that’s where I think the preponderance of the investment will be.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">Security is something weighs on my mind all the time. We have an extraordinarily robust, and I’m knocking wood as I say this, cybersecurity organization. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars. We have hundreds of people who work in the group. We’re very conscious of anybody that -- any system or organization that in any way, shape or form is going to come anywhere near VisaNet, goes through incredible scrutiny in terms of their security. When we look at the acquisitions we’re doing now, they will be integrated into VisaNet until we are completely and totally comfortable that we’ve got their cybersecurity capabilities that where they need to be before we fully integrate them.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">So, you never know, the bad guys are continuing to invest as much as the good guys. And we got to stay out ahead of it. We got to remain vigilant. And it’s something that we at Visa believe that security is a critical underpinning of the trust in the payment ecosystem. And given our place in that ecosystem, we believe we have obligation to stay vigilant in our cybersecurity. It’s one of the reasons we’re pushing tokenization, so that we can devalue data. It’s one of the reasons we’re building Consumer Transaction Controls. So, consumers can have a role in protecting their security and their data and the use of their payment credentials over time. And we will -- this is an area we’ll continue to invest a lot of money in.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Mike Milotich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Jordan, we have time for one last question.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Our last question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""question"">James Friedman</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">I just wanted to ask, Al, in your prepared remarks, you alluded to the used cases of tap-and-pay and the tax rate between transaction growth and volume growth, you referenced that 2.5 times accelerator in the UK. Is there anything unique about the UK market or do we think of that as a template of things to come? Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong><span class=""answer"">Al Kelly</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">Jamie, the only thing I can say and I think a bit unique or different about the UK market is that we have been in the transit system there for longer than we have in most other big markets around the world. And as I also said in my remarks, we are finding that transit is one of those things that really creates the habit and what people are commuting home -- to work and home 10 times a week, and they are tapping and get used to it. They realize and look to tap in all kinds of instances, particularly instances where heretofore they were using cash for lower ticket purchases. So, I think that as we continue to pursue the 200-plus transit projects that we have going on around the world, not certainly including the one I referenced in my remarks in terms of the MTA here in New York where we’re seeing really nice results in just a kind of a seven-week period since we’ve been up and running. I expect that in markets where we are able to penetrate the transit system and get high levels of adoption of tap-and-pay in general, I think, we’ll see similar type of results. That said, we’ll have to see how it plays out over time.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Mike Milotich</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">We’d like to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or email our Investor Relations team. Thanks again. And have a great day.</p>]"

After what was a very disappointing second quarter for us, it is pleasing to be able to report that this quarter has been broadly in line with our expectations. That said, the pressures we have seen for sometimes continue to impact our businesses and we still have a lot to do to deliver the transformation that will allow us to get ahead of the market trends again and return our company to strong and consistent growth.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">We were clear that the action we were undertaking to address the market changes take time and the impact will therefore not fully be reflected in our financial performance until future financial years. But we have been working hard to accelerate our plans and program.</p>, <p class=""p p1"">I have repeatedly said that we have, within our company, the skills and the assets we need to address the challenges that we face as our markets evolve and transform. Last quarter, we told you that we would focus on accelerating the work we are doing to transform our company. We are doing that.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">The Transformational Cost Management Program that we began early this year is one of the underlying foundations of the changes that we need to make. Most importantly, this program will help drive a structural change in the company, making us a more efficient, more agile and more responsive organization.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">It is expected to provide a significant portion of the funding required for our major technology upgrade and development investments. And, of course, an element of it will help to give us a bridge in our financial performance, as we restructure our businesses to better meet the needs of an ever more rapidly changing market.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">James and Alex will address some of these points, as they talk you through the quarter, which I will ask them to do now. James?</p>, <p class=""p p2""><strong>James Kehoe</strong></p>, <p class=""p p2"">Thank you, Stefano, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $1.47, a constant currency decline of 2.4% versus prior year. The results were slightly ahead of our expectations and included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. Overall, we are tracking well against our strategic goals.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">We are quite encouraged by U.S. comp sales, which were exactly what we needed to deliver to stay on track to meet our full year expectations. And while it is still early days, our Transformational Cost Management Program is very much on track and accelerating. Based on our performance in the quarter, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect the year to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Let's now look in more detail at the numbers. In the third quarter, sales increased 0.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.9%, mainly due to growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and the strong performance from our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Adjusted operating income declined 11.7%, or 10.4% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower pharmacy margins and a decline in front of store sales in the U.S. and lower results in Boots UK. Adjusted EPS declined 4% to $1.47, a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This includes a 5.8 percentage point contribution from our share repurchase program.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">GAAP operating income declined 24.7%, including $86 million of expenses related to the implementation of our Transformational Cost Management Program and $115 million relating to our share of AmerisourceBergen's impairment of PharMEDium. In total, these adjustments account for more than 50% of the year-on-year decline. GAAP EPS declined 16.5% to $1.13 per share.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Year-to-date sales increased 4.9%, including a currency headwind of 1.9%. On a constant currency basis, year-to-date sales were up 6.8%, reflecting 7.7% growth in Retail Pharmacy USA and 8% growth in Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Adjusted operating income declined 8.9% or 7.8% on a constant currency basis. This was more than offset by a 4.8 percentage point contribution from share repurchases and 3.2% from tax, contributing to an increase in adjusted EPS, which was up 1.6% on a constant currency basis.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Now let's look at the performance of our divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Sales increased 2.3% in the quarter, mainly due to pharmacy brand inflation and pharmacy script growth. Organic sales increased 2.9%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.9% and gross margin declined 140 basis points, mostly due to pharmacy.</p>, <p class=""p p2"">Adjusted SG&amp;A spend decreased 0.7%. And adjusted SG&amp;A was 17.3% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage point compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating income declined 13.8% in the quarter, procurement savings, pharmacy script growth and continued SG&amp;A savings were not enough to offset reimbursement pressure and the lower front of store sales. These results also included store and labor investments of $40 million in the quarter, equivalent to approximately 270 basis points of adjusted operating income.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. Total pharmacy sales increased 4.3%, reflecting higher brand inflation, prescription volume growth and a strong growth in central specialty, which grew 8.6% year-on-year. Comp pharmacy sales increased 6% and comp prescriptions grew 4.7% in the quarter, a strong improvement on the first half growth of 1.9%.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Market share was 21.2% in the quarter, down 50 basis points versus prior year, due entirely to our store optimization program. Pharmacy gross profit declined versus prior year, as script growth was more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was around 150 basis points lower than last year, due to continued reimbursement pressure, adverse mix associated with brand inflation, and a 50 basis point impact due to the faster growing specialty business. These impacts were partially offset by procurement savings. The key to offsetting long-term reimbursement pressure is, building scale, driving efficiency and creating a sizable health care services business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning next to our U.S. Retail business. Total retail sales decreased 2.9% and were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Comp retail sales declined 1.1%, an improvement on the first half comp decline of 3.5%. Tobacco accounted for 150 basis points of the comp sales decline, but we did benefit from a 65 basis point tailwind as a result of the cough cold and flu season.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Retail gross profit declined mostly due to lower sales, which as I mentioned earlier, were negatively impacted by our store optimization program. Gross margin was down slightly by 20 basis points, an improving trend versus the second quarter, as we rebalanced our promotional mix. We expect to see a continued improvement in gross margin trends in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning next to Retail Pharmacy International. As usual, I'll talk to constant currency numbers. Total sales declined 1.6%, mainly due to a 1% decline in Boots U.K. in a challenging market. Boots U.K. comp pharmacy sales increased 0.8%, reflecting prescription growth in the quarter. Whereas comp retail sales declined 2.6%, as we continued to gain share in a weak market.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Our beauty reinvention is now in place in 26 stores, and we remain on track to introduce 25 new brands in 2019. Adjusted operating income was down 10.5% due to weak retail sales and lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. Our U.K. pharmacy business was impacted by temporary industry-wide NHS underfunding and higher generic pricing. These impacts were only partially offset by prescription volume growth. We are taking actions to address our U.K. cost base, and I will cover these a little later.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning now to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, which I'll also discuss in constant currency. The division delivered another strong quarter with sales up 8.3%, led by emerging markets. Our U.K. performance was aided in part by a customer contract change mentioned last quarter, which contributed 2.3% to revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 9.4%, reflecting strong gains in Turkey and solid results from our European business.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">Turning next to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion for the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow was $2 billion. Operating cash flow was impacted by headwinds of around $1.4 billion. We are lapping a one-time prior year of working capital benefit of $502 million, cash tax payments are $395 million higher, mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform.</p>, <p class=""p p3"">This year includes legal settlements of $276 million. And we have $200 million of cash costs relating to the ongoing Rite Aid store optimization and integration, and the transformational cost management program. Underlying working capital increased approximately $500 million, primarily due to higher sales.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Cash capital investment was $1.2 billion for the first nine months, $264 million higher than the prior year. This was due mostly for the impact of the Rite Aid store conversions.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning now to our Transformational Cost Management Program. We remain on target to deliver $1.5 billion in annual cost savings by fiscal 2022. Our smart spending benchmarking is complete, targets and execution plans are setup, and we're accelerating a wide-ranging program to reduce pharmacy cost to fill. The 20% headcount reduction at our Boots U.K. headquarters and the reorganization of our U.S. fuel supervision structure are now complete.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">On digitalization, our Microsoft cloud migration is moving at pace, and we have now started working on optimizing our many IT vendors. Work has also began on building out compelling consumer-value propositions. Given the difficult market conditions in the U.K., we have completed the review of our store portfolio, and have started a store optimization program that will impact around 200 locations over the course of the next 18 months.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Many of these 200 stores are loss making, and approximately two-thirds of them are within walking distance of another Boots store. While the stores we plan to close represent around 8% of our store base, we expect the revenue impact will be around 1%. We do not expect a significant impact on colleagues, as we plan to redeploy to nearby stores. We are also reviewing our real estate footprint in the U.S. and accelerating the pace of change, especially in our U.S. supply chain. More to follow in the coming months, as we work through these key opportunities.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Turning to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the third quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations aided by some timing benefits. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect adjusted EPS to be roughly flat on a constant currency basis.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">As a reminder, last quarter we told you to expect a range of plus or minus 2%. Given the normal level of volatility in a business of this size, we feel this range is still appropriate. Let me just give you a couple of assumptions. As you update your models, you should now be building in $0.06 of negative currency impacts, and this is $0.02 worse than our prior guidance.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We continue to project full year share repurchases of $3.8 billion, contributing 4.8 percentage points to adjusted EPS growth. And, we now project a full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 15.5%, compared to our earlier guidance of 16% to 17%. The lower rate reflects nonrecurring discrete benefits and changes to our geographic mix.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">When we provided our original fiscal 2019 guidance, we highlighted incremental store and labor investments of around $150 million. As we accelerate the pace of our digital investments, we now expect total incremental spend of approximately $175 million with a significant portion of the additional spend coming in the fourth quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">Let me finish by highlighting the change in revenue trends coming from Rite Aid. We saw positive revenue contributions from the Rite Aid acquisition in the first two quarters of the year. From this quarter on, Rite Aid is actually a headwind to reported revenue due to the ongoing store optimization program.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">I'll now hand you over to Alex, and he will update you on some of the business initiatives we have underway in the U.S.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Alex Gourlay</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Thank you, James, and hello, everyone. During the quarter, we continue to make progress in our four strategic priorities; accelerating digitalization, transforming and restructuring our retail offering, creating a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy, and rolling out our Transformational Cost Management program.</p>, <p class=""p p4"">We'll also continuing to develop our omni-channel offering. Our Walgreens app has now been downloaded 57.3 million times, up 10.5% since last year. Around 26% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels in the quarter, up 18.4% since last year, and also increased our active Balance Rewards members to 90.2 million.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In Retail, our leading beauty brands No7 performed exceptionally well in the quarter. In Walgreens, sales of No7 were up by over 50% helped by the launch and advertising of the No7 Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum and our other retail partners saw significant growth.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In addition to beauty, we're working on refreshing our own brand portfolio in Walgreens to drive sales and improve the customer value proposition. During the past two years over 60% of the Walgreens own brand product portfolio has been re-launched or rebranded enhancing the customer offer through better value and quality to deliver improvements in sales and margin. This work is ongoing.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Rite Aid is very much on track. Against our store optimization program we've completed 631 of the planned 750 stores closures and we continue to see good customer retention.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">As to the many Walgreens own ready stores, 394 have been successfully converted to Walgreens and we expect to complete the Rite Aid integration by the end of fiscal year 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We've taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our partners including LabCorp and Humana and as we announced during the quarter VillageMD. With VillageMD we will be opening five state-of-the-art primary care clinics in the eastern area by the end of the year branded Village Medical at Walgreens.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We also remain on track to open 125 LabCorp outlets at Walgreens stores this year. And finally on Kroger the teams are working well together and so far the initial customer response has been positive.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">I'll now hand you back to Stefano.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Stefano Pessina</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Thank you, Alex. So as you have heard we have already delivered what we expected. But we have a lot of work ahead to get the business growing again. We have been working hard to initiate or accelerate the changes we need to keep us in line with or leading the market.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We are investing heavily in updating our systems and the infrastructure, creating efficiencies and capabilities, which will give us scope of development for many years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We are developing new ways to engage with our customers, introducing new services and products through new channels. We are working with partners who bring us the skills, resources, scale and expertise that complement our own to accelerate our development give us access to new thinking market and allow us to create significant new income streams.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">At the same time, we are continuing our focus on transforming our traditional areas of business but rest the challenges of our core markets. Economic and reimbursement pressures have long been and remain a fact of life for us. Over the years we have developed values at different levels to mitigate the impact of this pressure.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">In recent years, a major element of this mitigation has been improvement in generic procurement, made possible by changes in the global generics manufacturing sector, ongoing patent expires and significant development in the actual procurement process, all of which have led to continued improvement in buying terms.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">These buying benefits have enabled us to compensate for the significant demand made on us by payers. As we have made clear, the level to which we can mitigate current and future reimbursement pressure toward generic procurement has reduced, although it will continue to be an important lever for many years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">Recognizing this we are accelerating other levers to mitigate the pressures. We have more to do to cost saving and efficiency and we expect consistent savings well into the future. There is no doubt that over time we also have to build a range of services and service level that drive benefits for our payer partners.</p>, <p class=""p p5"">We believe that the future of pharmacy is aligned to a wider range of health care services provided efficiently and conveniently in a community setting. This is why we are exploring partnerships with a wide range of innovative expert in various fields, allowing us to offer a better service more effectively and at a lower cost to offset than we would be able to do if we had set these services up on our own or paid a significant premium for them. Of course, many of the services are still being tested or are still in development.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Let me clear, however, while the number of partnership we are piloting has the potential to have a meaningful impact on our business, no single one of these will define or frame our future. In truth it will be a combination of products and services, working together in the convenience of a community pharmacy that will forward the basis of our future customer proposition. The mixture of products and services will inevitably bring together a range of complex and differentiated business models. Their economics will be least impact based on changes to individual's health condition management and over all wellbeing over many years.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">The consequence of getting these services right has a huge potential benefit for us for our partners and for our customers. But if we rush into them without truly understanding the operational or financial model, we have the risk of wasting an extraordinary amount of time, resources and more. We might be sure of what we are doing before we enter into these businesses in scale.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Today many people are looking at our company indeed at our sector, focused on the immediate risk they perceive us to face. And I understand this; we are far from complacent about the pressures we face.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">However, we can see the inherent strength of our business. There is an ever increasing demand for effective, efficient and convenient support for people to manage their health conditions while leading productive and fulfilling lives in their local communities. The unique positioning of community pharmacy and our place in the sector gives us practical and financial scale, reach and strength.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">It gives us a robust platform, on which to evolve and transform our company to meet the ever changing needs of the markets we serve. And it gives us a fantastic foundation from, which to deliver innovation, growth and value for our customers and our shareholders for many years to come.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. Now we will take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p6"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Steven Valiquette</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Great. Thanks. Good morning, Stefano and James. Thanks for taking the question. So, as the U.S. Retail Pharmacy business remains difficult really for all types of stores and operators across the entire industry, we're getting the sense that there could be an additional opportunity among the larger mass merchandisers in the U.S. for a store-within-a-store deal where a Walgreens or a CDS could take over the pharmacies within a specific large U.S. mass merchandiser.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">So I'm just curious to hear about your current appetite for an opportunity like this right now in the U.S. given the simultaneous store rationalization program that you're going through right now and also your other initiatives in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Hi, Steve its Alex here. One of our strategies clearly there is to grow volume and to make our business bigger to get scale. So we -- and also partnership is really important to us as we've said many, many times. So with the market changes and these changes are really -- you can see the number of pharmacies in the U.S. is in decline as measured for the first time for a long time.</p>, <p class=""p p6"">We are obviously open to partnership in this area. We bring scale, we bring expertise and we're investing as Stefano said in his remarks and Jim said in pharmacy and the pharma supply chain. So we're open. And, of course, we’ll look for every opportunity available providing a mix that makes sense for us our partners and increase the quality of our business.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Steven Valiquette</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Okay. Just one other quick one. As we think about the narrow network opportunities for calendar 2020. Just curious if you could see the potential for meaningful market share shifts for 2020 among the large retail pharmacies like yourself given the level of RFP activity? Or do you think it's going to be a quieter year for calendar 2020 just in terms of narrow network opportunities and potential market shifts within the marketplace?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, Steve, it's Alex again. We think it's probably more normal. Again, we've laid out our plans in terms of the heightened growth that we expect. And we think it's a more normal year. Now of course, within that there is always opportunities and there is always challenges, but we think it's a probably more normal year than 2020.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Steven Valiquette</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. Got you.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay, thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Robert Jones</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Great. Thanks for the questions. James, you mentioned that the results included some timing benefits from the fourth quarter. I was just curious, if you could share the source of those benefits and anything on the size of those benefits would be helpful?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Okay. Yes. Roughly the -- we had two impacts in the quarter. One was timing. And I would say that's around $0.03 or $35 million is our best estimate. And the other one is whereas we also highlighted in the comments, we're ramping up the amount of spending in store labor and now digital and development expense. So we've increased the spending on the full year by 150 to -- from $150 million to $175 million. There is about a $0.01 of that in the fourth quarter. So think about roughly around $50 million. Around $0.04-ish was it. And when you get to the two timing items, one was $0.02 of the $0.03, but essentially the timing of payer contracts, when you do the compliance and true-up part of you or his outcomes or whether you hit volumes in certain tiers. And that's the normal course of business, but we had expected that in Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">And then a $0.01 is coming from expense timing. We accelerated some real estate savings from Q4 into Q3. So it was actually one of the quieter quarters in terms of volatility very few surprises. What's interesting here -- maybe I'll take the opportunity. As you start looking out into Q4, because this takes some income out of Q4. Our Q4 targets is actually quite -- when you start working through it, you start working out your estimates. Bear in mind, we had two large onetime items last year. And on an EPS basis, we're cycling through these.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">The first one is you'll recall there was a large true-up, a curtailment benefit relating to retiree medical. That was $110 million. And then in the prior quarter of last year, we made an adjustment for legal cost which was onetime and that was approximately $60 million. So that's another $0.05. So if you think about it, we have a 10 percentage point headwind on EPS in Q4. So we actually -- if you -- when you dissect Q4, we're looking forward to pretty good improving margin trends on the gross margin. And the headwind is all on the overheads and it's all due to onetime items in the prior year.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">So I think as you shift through it -- this -- the volatility in Q3 was actually quite low. When you get into Q4, think more that we have two large items last year. So actually, when you analyze the result, the core performance is actually quite -- it's improving quite a bit. I hope that's helped a little bit.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Robert Jones</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">That's very helpful, James. Thank you. And I guess just one other follow-up. In your prepared remarks, you guys highlighted again that you're reviewing the real estate footprint in the U.S. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit just your thoughts around, how we should be thinking about the store rationalization. Is this going to be a bigger focus? Or is this kind of just ongoing course of business at this point?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Hi, Bob, it's Alex here. Yes, it's more ongoing course of business. In a way this is regular. We have over 9,000 drug stores in America. Therefore, things change customers shift opportunities move. We're also thinking about new formats as we spoke before and answered previous questions. So this is just normal business.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">And just to add though, the calculations are complex. We have to look at the lease portfolio, it's a store-by-store assessment. And the teams are working through 9,500 stores, which is quite the heavy workload. And we just recently confirmed the 200 stores in the U.K. and moving -- we'll move ahead aggressively on that. And it's quite interesting as you go through it, about 60% of the stores in the U.K. that we're closing lose money. Not all of them, but some of the others are very like the Rite Aid optimization. Where there is -- think of it as a fly by. So we closed two stores, close to each other in the U.K. And sometimes they were a five-minute walking distance and they're transferring over to scripts, but you're taking out fixed cost structure.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">So the calculations are quite complex. It's -- you have to assess are you leaving a trading area, which we generally don't like to do. We want to preserve our presence both in the U.K. and in the U.S. And I would highlight that in the U.K., we highlighted in the comments, we're reducing the store count by 8%. The impact on revenue is around 1%. So I don't want to call that rounding. But it has no strategic impact on our ability to maintain our strength of our position in the U.K. I would actually argue on the contrary. It makes us even stronger, because we're a profitable operator in the U.K. market.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Robert Jones</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Great. Thanks for all that.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Eugene Kim</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Hi. This is Eugene dialed in for Justin. Quick question on the U.S. pharmacy gross margin. It decline 150 basis points year-over-year, if we read it correctly. And it seems like Q3 was a clean quarter to compare year-over-year, because FEP specialty contract lapped. How do we should think about -- how should we think about this going forward? Is this a rate of decline in the near term that we can -- that we should consider?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">I'll take a shot on that. And I'll ask Alex to weigh in afterwards. I think the -- we cycle through the FEP contracts, the specialty business growing at 8.6%. We would expect that always to grow at faster than the core business. So we'll always be somewhat dilutive to margins.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">One other thing there is other dynamics in the quarter. So in the quarter, we sold more branded and the margin on branded is lower than it is on generic and that creates a mix impact as well. And that's as significant as any other impact. And the problem is, we can't project with accuracy, the individual mix in any single quarter. But if you take out a lot of these mix items, the core reimbursement net of procurement and other mitigations was actually a pretty solid quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p8"">We do expect some improvement in both retail and gross margin – sorry, retail and pharmacy gross margins in Q4. That's as far as we're willing to go. So this is not something you should take and extrapolate out as 150 basis points on pharmacy. We do expect some improvements in the trend in Q4. But mix and everything else plays into it, it would be a very long discussion. Alex?</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Yes. I think in terms of how we feel about margin going forward, we've always stated we recognize reimbursement pressures there and we'll stay there and that's how do we compensate for it. And as James has just said, we are seeing the ability to compensating more in Q4 than Q3 as the trends compare. I think in particular, a couple of areas, which are just interesting going forward. First of all, we are getting paid more for I would say value-based contracts, particularly in Medicare D. So we're starting to hit some of the performance targets, which is encouraging. And I think also, we continue to have the opportunity to work differently in some networks.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">For example, again, I would point to the prime contract, we did some time ago, where we have a different approach to marketplace, where we're really much more transparent. And again, that process we believe is -- will become more I say -- I will say available to the market going forward that has been in the past. So it's -- if the reimbursement doesn't go away, the margin is under pressure as we've often said. But we continue to be innovative, we work creatively and we work hard on new levers as well as the old levers that we've spoken about a lot.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. I mean, any comments we make on the Q4 margins, these are obviously all factored into our full year guidance. We're just giving you the perspective that we had a tough Q2 on reimbursement, which was one of the highest numbers in history. Q3 was a tough quarter as well. We will -- as we said in the previous call, we will start to see an improving trend in Q4 on the gross margin side, but the caution is to call out those two large onetime items that are putting pressure on overheads. And the good news on that is they don't repeat in the future. It's just impacting Q4.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Eugene Kim</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Got it. Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yeah. Hi, good morning. Last quarter you directed us to fiscal year 2020 EBIT being moderating up year-over-year and I think flat EPS. Are you still -- with everything you're seeing in the marketplace are you still expecting this?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Ricky we're going to just comment on current year 2019. We don't want to get into a practice of going back to discussing long-term models or 2020 guidance. What we will be doing is in the next conference call, we will give comprehensive guidance on all of the assumptions around 2020. So, we're not going back to a discussion on the -- we just refer people back to the previous material that we placed out there in Q2.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. And then just a follow-up. In the prepared remark when you talked about the review portfolio I think you also said that you're kind of like looking at the U.S. supply chain for additional improvements. Can you then give us a little bit more color on what the opportunity is there? And what are you seeing in terms of generic deflation trends as a headwind?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Yes. So, I'll maybe split the -- I think we answered the portfolio question already Ricky so I'll move onto the second question supply chain. I would say we're halfway into our replacement of our core supply chain system from retail in the USA the SAP HANA S/4 software is going into stores and into DCs. So, it's very clear that we now have opportunities with new tools capabilities and data, especially speed of the data we didn't have before.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">So, as that goes through we'll give more updates in terms of what that means in terms of projections. But we're encouraged by the progress there but we're only halfway through it.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I think secondly we have just hired as you saw quite recently a very experienced global supply chain. We don't call them Nielsen. And again we're working hard with the team to really understand how to be even more focused on the new capabilities we're building in the business going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">I think in terms of generics, as a Stefano said in his pre-prepared remarks, we continue to be very, very pleased with the performance of our WBAD office. And again we see the opportunity going forward to continue to drive values through that WBAD office into a global platform but also into America. So, I think that's how we see the supply chain piece. And -- what was the third part of the question?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Gerald Gradwell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">The generic deflation.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">The generic deflation, yes. I mean we don't see any difference to what's been recorded in the marketplace to be honest. We see this I will say a low single-digit deflation. As they have spoken about we see generics coming off patents in a way that going to describe the others.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And, of course, we pay a lot of attention to this because it has a material impact on our ability to reduce our register cost of goods. And we feel comfortable that all that's captured in the guidance that we gave last quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Yes. And Ricky just to add in the low single digit Alex refers to includes new molecules. If you strip out new molecules the most recent quarter had at least these are our numbers not market numbers. We had -- we saw deflation of around 9%, right. So, it's still up at a healthy clip and that will support continued savings in generic procurement. And this is -- the prior quarter was 9.4%. So, it's still up there in a healthy high single-digit.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Then you were -- the market builds in new molecules. I'm very excited about the supply chain piece here in the U.S. because we now have a team setup looking to shrink so stock office. Whether that's left in-store or at stock office and warehouses. And we're using teams from Microsoft. So, this shows the benefit of the bigger Microsoft agreement. There's data scientists on this who are helping us build data links to understand what is going on and true causes of shrink and how to eliminate it and these are $100 million, $200 million opportunities.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">And that's without getting into the working capital side of it. So, I don't want that to be lost. Once we have SAP for Hana in place across the 9,500 stores that stock fill a visibility that we don't have today. Now, we expect significant reductions in the level of inventory required to be held at store levels. So, -- and this is a lot [Technical Difficulty] will be huge. So, you would expect that exiting 2020, we're starting to see material reductions in inventory levels.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Gerald Gradwell</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Thank you. I'd like to dig in on the international performance. And I understand we've seen some of the generic pricing fluctuations, you also made a comment about weakness or a temporary weakness in underfunding. Could you expand on that? And how incremental is it for the pressures that we've already spoken about the last 12 to 18 months?</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Hi Eric, it's Alex here. Yes. I mean let me start with the last question first which is the underfunding point. The U.K. government pay in a certain way they -- I don't want to go into detail of it but fundamentally it's a market payment for all the pharmacies in the U.K. And if you go into what's called the PSNC website there is more details there about how the how that works. So, we are pretty convinced there's been underfunding in the last period.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">Now, of course, working within the pharmacy contractors and the PSNC, we're now debating that with the government in a positive way as our new contracts are put in place. So, that's what we refer to. And of course we can't make any further comments until that negotiation is complete.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">But I think in terms of the overall performance of the business. We are making good progress in terms of reinvigorating the Boots model in the U.K. in very difficult times. I don't have to tell you how difficult the marketplace is there. For example, this morning, we opened a fantastic new store, a new concept store in Covent Garden that was skewed around the corner. And this is a health, wellness, and beauty concept store which will not only feed the future of Boots, but could also of course give us some great ideas for U.S. market as well.</p>, <p class=""p p10"">On top of that we've done a lot of digitalization. We've digitalized the Advantage card which is still the most popular card in the U.K. by some way in terms of beauty and treat cards and a lot of customers use it. I think it's well under 17 million holders today.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">We've also created digital pharmacy we've launched that for the first time in the U.K. in terms of managing prescriptions copies some of the great ideas that we could pass across the Walgreens as part of the merger.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And of course the cost programs James already referred to in his remarks in terms of moving money from maybe the older model into investing in the future of the Boots business. So, that's a story really where we're using the current market situation to make sure that we're investing our future. And we're seeing some interesting lead indicators of performance. And of course we'll give you more updates as that develops.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Is your PSNC comment suggesting that your business is now adjusted for the changes that have made -- been made to date and you hope that those there might be some improvement moving forward? But you're basing the business from where we sit today?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Yes absolutely. I would say that's an accurate reflection of where we are.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes, that's a fair point. I think would emphasize the word temporary. So we expect an improvement in Q4 and back to normal levels of funding next year.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Yes.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">That's helpful. And could you just -- on the potential store reduction you mentioned that employees may move to other stores. Can you help us with the way that you run those stores and maybe employment where you could see I guess the revenue impact only 1%, but it is 8% of the store base? Will you continue to carry all of the employee cost?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. I mean it's really straightforward. These are relatively small pharmacies. James said two-thirds are within a walking distance of another Boots pharmacy. And the main cost there to be honest is the cost of the pharmacist. We have pharmacist turnover like any company would have and we simply see that as we have been able to manage the cost while retaining quality people that we need to take care of customers and communities.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And remember we learned a very important lesson here in the USA that if you retain similar face of the pharmacist and health care assistants in the local pharmacy then very often the customers will transfer the script to the people who they know and trust. So, this is economically important to us as well.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And its 8% of the stores it's 3% I believe of the square footage. So, that the employee impact is much lower than the percentage of stores. And then the revenue impact is much lower because there are less efficient stores. So, it's actually quite logical.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">And then there's a fair amount of turnover in general in an employee base of -- we have 56,000 people in the U.K. But there's a fair amount of turnover and I think we've seen in the past most you manage the place the majority of people.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Thank you.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Elizabeth Anderson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I was wondering if you could expand on some of the comments that Stefano made about generic procurement in particular sort of areas of future savings that you see.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Hi, it's Alex here. Yes. I think, I'll say what I said already and Stefano said that it clearly, we still have a very efficient effective and innovative model out of WBAD and we continue to work in a dimension which we think is slightly different. We prefer to have contracts with manufacturers to give them certainty of supply, so that we get certainty of supply back in the marketplace. That's really important to the customers and allows us to plan together in a different way and that's how we work.</p>, <p class=""p p11"">Having said that, we all know that the level of opportunities as Stefano said is changing going forward. It's not -- we're not going to make savings, we will make savings, it's just changing. So, we have setup some innovative partnerships already. The partnership we setup with Express Scripts for example is one where we're combining the volume from a PBM with the volume from the Retail Pharmacy. And we continue to look at other ways of making sure that we've got the right scale and mix of partners going into WBAD going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">I think secondly, the manufacturers are thinking differently as well. And again, we can't talk on their behalf, but you probably have some of the things they have been saying. And we think that our approach to buying in partnership with them and the way that we organize, how we work with them, will continue to give us advantage into the future going forward.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">Of course, in the future, other markets may open up. We don't know that in reality and we're not banking on that particularly and how we see the plan going forward. But clearly, things will change in one direction and could change again. And having a global perspective and global volumes, we think will give us global opportunities in the future as well.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Elizabeth Anderson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">All right, thanks. That’s very helpful.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Glen Santangelo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just had one of the follow-up on this reimbursement issue one more time. If I heard you correctly, one of the main key is you keep pointing to is that in order to combat the reimbursement pressure, you'll need scale, but yourself and your closest competitor you guys have more scale than anyone else in the marketplace and you seem to be having issues. And so, I was wondering if you could comment more broadly on the 65,000 to 70,000 pharmacy counters out there. I mean, they must be obviously feeling more pressure than you. And I was just kind of curious, are you starting to see that total number come down? And I guess my question is can the reimbursement pressure subside until some of the capacity comes out of the market?</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">It's Alex here. Again, I think we've said already. The way that we measure the market internally, we are starting to see some pharmacies close. And I think these numbers are pretty open in the marketplace as well. So, that is bound to happen and not reopen. And so, I think that is a fact you can check obviously out there. I mean secondly, you only have to look at the comments from other competitive marketplaces to see the pressure that we are all feeling in the marketplace.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">The other side of the coin is that, we continue to believe strongly, the community care and the pharmacy, the physical location in the community with the pharmacist available and accessible, I know is a really great opportunity for not just pharmacies, but for health care, all connected through data, all connected with other health care professionals, all connected to bringing forward new solutions going forward. That's why we are so excited about the work we're doing, not just with Microsoft, but with as Stefano said other relevant partners. For example Verily, we've managed as well and LabCorp. And I can assure you the list could go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them.</p>, <p class=""p p12"">So, we are really confident about the future of pharmacy. We're really confident that the model that we see today will change, driven by new technologies and the same need that customers and patients have always had which they have a conversation with their local pharmacist in their local community.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""question"">Glen Santangelo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Hey Alex, maybe if I can just follow up on the one just sort of comment you were talking about with respect to some of the partnerships. I mean over the last year and a half, we talked a lot about the JV strategies and trying to crack the code of generating additional foot traffic. And it seems like there has been mix results on that front. May be I'm wondering, if you could just sort of reiterate exactly where the strategy stands today. And maybe what has worked better than what you might have thought? What maybe hasn't worked as well as what you thought? And I'll stop there. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">Alex Gourlay</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Thank you. Thanks Glen. I'll give an example of where we are very comfortable, which is our FedEx partnership. Again, we are seeing the footfall that we expected. We are seeing the halo from our footfall that we expected i.e., new customers to Walgreens and we are also seeing the opportunities to work closely with the FedEx team strategically to develop new customer propositions in the corner drugstore. So that would be one example that we are very comfortable with.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">And of course, going forward, there'll be other partnerships which are really interesting. We mentioned already the Kroger partnership is going well and the customer reaction has been positive. So again, that's another example where we believe that Kroger are really are experts in food and they can help to really improve our customer proposition and value over time. But time will tell, if we can find the right model that works for both companies and also for customers.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Glen Santangelo</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Okay. Thanks.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Cherny</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Good morning and thanks for all the color so far. Just thinking about 4Q, I know you had talked about a number of the moving pieces and some of the reimbursement true-ups that you've seen so far year-to-date. With regards to the removal of pressure on Retail Pharmacy gross margins or at least less pressure, I guess, what gives you the confidence? And why do you think it should get better? Is there something in mix? Is there something in timing? Is it just the annualization or I guess the -- within year annualization of those pressures that you've talked about relative to last quarter and this quarter? I guess I just want to know a little bit about the why relative to the sequential gross margin improvement?</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong><span class=""answer"">James Kehoe</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">Yes. I think it's a little bit of everything you said actually, because you have to go back on a journey. Q2 was reimbursement pressure which we said I think was exceeded 30% of the full year reimbursement pressure. So, we would've set an unprecedented level. We saw it go back to more normalized level in Q3. But we saw some slowness on the procurement savings in Q3. And we're going to see those -- both of the variables equalize in Q4. So it gets back to -- you can't really look at it as reimbursement. It's reimbursement net of the mitigation. The biggest two are, one is procurement savings and there's being some tuning between Q3 and Q4 there.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">When you get to volume, I want to highlight, we had a great quarter in Q3. We set some fairly challenging goals internally. Bear in mind, we had script volume for the first half on a comp basis below 2%. So to come in the high fours was something we needed to do it and we need those kind of numbers. That's number one.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">We're also very pleased with the way retail came in. If you strip it back a little bit, it's down 1.1. We were tracking in the first half of a pretty disappointing 3.5% comp store decline. But the change-on-change is quite impressive. We won't deliver exactly the same numbers, but we will continue to hold onto some of these trend improvements.</p>, <p class=""p p13"">I think what will happen in Q4 is, you will see a little bit of stabilization of the topline outlook together with some improvement in both businesses on the margin side. So it's a confluence of trends. And I'll highlight again then you've got these two big one-time items in overheads. So, it's too early to call victory in Q4 obviously, but that's where our current expectation has improved gross margins and continued stabilization of scripts and the same-store sales and retail. I hope that helps you as you think through it.</p>, <p class=""p p13""><strong>Gerald Gradwell</strong></p>, <p class=""p p13"">I'm afraid, but that's probably all we have time for. I know we haven't got to all your questions, but as ever the IR team are around to answer them all. And I'm sorry for those of you who didn't get to ask questions today. We'll be back again next quarter. Thank you very much indeed.</p>, <p class=""p p14""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p14"">This concludes today's conference call.

Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will turn the call over to Bob to get started.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Robert Iger</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I've been doing earnings calls for a long time, and this is one of our more complicated ones. We certainly have a lot to cover and discuss. This is our first full quarter since we closed our acquisition of 21st Century Fox in March. Now our results reflect our efforts to integrate the assets, businesses and talent we acquired in order to enhance and advance our strategic transformation. Implementation of our integration plan is well underway, a complex process given the magnitude of the endeavor, and we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute our strategy to drive maximum value from the combined company, and our appreciation for the long-term value we can create has increased. </p>, <p class=""p p1"">I'm going to ask Christine to take you through the numbers, and then I'll be back to provide some additional perspective that should give you greater insight into our bullish view of the future.</p>, <p class=""p p1""><strong>Christine McCarthy</strong></p>, <p class=""p p1"">Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.35. Our third quarter results reflect a full quarter of performance of the 21CF businesses we acquired and are still in the process of integrating and full consolidation of Hulu. Results this quarter include a number of factors we recognize can be challenging to model. In a moment, I'll discuss our Q3 results in greater detail and shed additional light on these factors, and then I'll highlight a few items that will impact our Q4 results. Since we are in the middle of our fiscal 2020 planning process, I expect to have more to say on the key drivers of next year's results during our Q4 call. The 21CF businesses we acquired excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu had a slightly negative impact on third quarter segment operating income. The total adverse impact on segment operating income including full consolidation of Hulu and the effect of intersegment eliminations was about $300 million. Overall, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF had a dilutive impact on our Q3 EPS before purchase accounting of about $0.60 compared to the $0.35 guidance we provided last quarter. The initial guidance of $0.35 reflected our assumptions about the business at the time. However, there were a couple of 21CF businesses whose results came in significantly lower than our expectations, in particular, the 21CF film studio and Star. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">I want to take a moment to discuss the primary drivers of the underperformance of these businesses, which are reflected in our studio and Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International segments. First, the 21CF film studio had an operating loss in the third quarter of about $170 million, which was driven by the underperformance of theatrical titles, including Dark Phoenix, marketing for future releases and development expenses, partially offset by TV/SVOD distribution. While 21CF's performance is not reflected in our prior year results, we estimate that 21CF film studio generated about $180 million of operating income in Q3 last year. On the other hand, I'll note that the performance of the Disney Film Studio continues to be incredibly strong. This quarter's theatrical slate including: Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the carryover success of Captain Marvel drove higher worldwide theatrical results compared to what was also an outstanding slate of films during the third quarter last year, which included Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2 and Black Panther. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Second, as you know, results at DTCI reflect ongoing investment in our direct-to-consumer businesses, and this quarter also included an operating loss at Star of about $60 million. We estimate Star generated about $150 million of operating income in the third quarter last year. Star's results this quarter came in well below our expectations and were driven primarily by a meaningful step-up in rights cost for the quadrennial Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League as revenue growth was more than offset by the incremental rights expense. There was an additional negative impact to EPS of about $0.06 as a result of the Hulu agreement we entered into with NBCU in May. The agreement provides us with full operational control of Hulu, and most of the $0.06 impact results from NBCU no longer being allocated its share of Hulu operating losses in our financial reporting. You'll find additional detail on the transaction and the financial impact in our 10-Q. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">At Parks, Experiences and Products, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at Consumer Products and Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic Parks and Resorts. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 3% in the third quarter but per capita spending was up a healthy 10% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 3%, and occupancy was up 2 percentage points to 88%. Despite domestic parks achieving record revenue in the third quarter, operating income was down slightly due to the decline in attendance and higher costs. Disneyland Resort had strong underlying attendance fundamentals, with growth in local, domestic and international visitation. We are very pleased with how guests have responded to Galaxy’s Edge and Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run as one of our most popular attractions. The decline in attendance at Disneyland Resort was primarily driven by lower annual passholder visitation as we managed demand for the first few weeks after opening Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in order to maintain a high level of guest satisfaction. And at Walt Disney World, our survey data suggest that guests are deferring visitation until after Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opens, which we believe contributed to the decline in attendance we saw during the third quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p2"">Looking ahead, we are excited for the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Walt Disney World and the opportunity to introduce guests to the Rise of the Resistance, our most technologically advanced and immersive attraction when that attraction opens at Walt Disney World in December and at Disneyland in January. Our domestic parks incurred incremental operating expenses during the quarter, including wage increases and pre-opening and operational expenses associated with the opening of Galaxy’s Edge. Results at our international operations were higher in the third quarter due primarily to growth at Disneyland Paris. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to higher results in our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was driven by higher revenue from sales of Toy Story and Avengers merchandise, partially offset by lower sales of Star Wars merchandise. Growth in comp store sales at our brick-and-mortar stores and higher online revenue drove the increase in retail for the quarter. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong segment operating income growth driven by the benefit from a full quarter of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland and growth at merchandise licensing. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to prior year while book rates are up 3%. At Media Networks, total affiliate revenue was up 20% in the third quarter and reflects the impact of the 21CF acquisition as well as underlying growth at our legacy Media Networks. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 16 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 8 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2.5 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At Broadcasting, lower programming expenses and higher affiliate revenue were more than offset by the impact of lower program sales and a decline in advertising revenue. Ad revenue was lower in the quarter as higher network rates were more than offset by lower viewership. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 35% above upfront levels. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">ABC Studios faced a difficult year-over-year program sales comparison since Q3 results last year reflected the sale of Luke Cage and this quarter, we had lower sales of How to Get Away with Murder and Designated Survivor compared to last year. Domestic cable results were up in the quarter due to the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses and higher operating income at ESPN, partially offset by a decline at Freeform. At ESPN, growth in operating income during the third quarter was due to higher advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs driven by contractual freight increases for MLB and NBA programming and new rights. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was up 13% in the third quarter. ESPN benefited from 2 extra NBA Finals games compared to last year. When you adjust for the mix and the total number of playoff games this year compared to last year, we estimate there was about an 8-point benefit to the year-over-year growth in advertising revenue. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic cash ad sales are pacing down compared to last year. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Results at our Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International segment reflect the consolidation of Hulu and ongoing investment at ESPN+ and Disney+. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $400 million. ESPN+ had a little over 2.4 million paid subscribers at the end of the third quarter, and Hulu had approximately 28 million paid subscribers. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">Now I'll turn to some thoughts about the fourth quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the quarter, which represents an increase of about $560 million over the fourth quarter last year. We expect the continued investment in our DTC services, including ESPN+ and Disney+, and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of our direct-to-consumer businesses of approximately $550 million, which is almost the entirety of the total segment change versus prior year. </p>, <p class=""p p3"">At Media Networks, there were a few items I'd like to mention that we believe will cause segment operating income to decline by about 10% in the fourth quarter compared to prior year. We expect that 21CF's television businesses to contribute about $200 million in operating income in the fourth quarter, with 2/3 of that contribution at Broadcasting and 1/3 at cable. We estimate 21CF's television businesses generated operating income of about $485 million in the fourth quarter last year. The expected year-over-year decline is due to a combination of factors, including lower program sales and higher content development expense, which are both related in part to our ongoing investment in our direct-to-consumer businesses. At ABC Studios, we expect a difficult program sales comparison given we sold two Marvel series, Daredevil and Iron Fist, during Q4 last year, and we don't expect comparable sales in Q4 this year. At ESPN, we expect higher programming expenses driven by contractual rate increases and launch costs for the ACC Network and lower ad revenue to more than offset growth in affiliate revenue. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">In aggregate, we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q4 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.45 per share. Despite these headwinds, we remain excited about the acquisition of 21CF and still expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. And we also remain on track to realize over $2 billion in cost synergies by fiscal 2021. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.</p>, <p class=""p p4""><strong>Robert Iger</strong></p>, <p class=""p p4"">Before I discuss our new strategy, I'd like to begin by singling out our studio, which is the envy of the industry. The studio has generated $8 billion in global Box Office in 2019, a new industry record. And we still have five months left in the calendar year with movies like Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker still to come. So far this year, we've released 5 of the top 6 movies including four that have generated more than $1 billion in global Box Office. Avengers: Endgame is now the highest grossing film in history with almost $2.8 billion worldwide. Captain Marvel, Aladdin and The Lion King have each surpassed $1 billion. And with more than $960 million in Box Office to date, Toy Story 4 will likely cross that threshold in the coming weeks. And all of these movies will be on Disney+ in the first year of launch. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">The studio co-chairs behind this record-setting performance, Alan Horn and Alan Bergman, are now redefining 20th Century Fox's film strategy for the future, applying the same discipline and creative standards behind the success of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. They're taking the Fox Studios in new direction, all new development slates will focus on a select group of high-quality movies for theatrical release as well as for our Hulu and Disney+ platforms. And Fox Searchlight will continue to make the prestige films it's known for while expanding its high-quality original storytelling into the DTC space. We see great long-term value in the broad collection of theatrical IP we acquired from Fox, including iconic movie franchises such as Avatar and Planet of the Apes as well as Marvel's X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Deadpool, which are now part of Marvel Studios under the leadership of Kevin Feige, the architect of the Marvel cinematic universe, which now includes 23 movies with a global Box Office of more than $22 billion to date. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">We're also focused on leveraging Fox's vast library of great titles to further enrich the content mix on our DTC platforms. For example, reimagining Home Alone, Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen and Diary of a Wimpy Kid for a new generation on Disney+. As I said a few times, we analyzed the 21st Century Fox opportunity entirely through the lens of our future business, evaluating the long-term potential especially related to accelerating our transformation into the DTC space on a global basis. As a result of the acquisition, we also now have full operational control of Hulu and a clear path to full ownership, providing another powerful platform for us to produce and distribute great content. Hulu will provide us with an excellent opportunity to leverage the capabilities of our television studios and brands, notably FX and ABC Television. </p>, <p class=""p p4"">The deal also added Star and Hotstar to our portfolio of businesses, giving us a significant presence in India, which will soon become the most populous country in the world. It's a huge market with interesting dynamics notably, a rapidly rising middle class with a strong and growing appetite for media, especially sports. To give you an idea of the value of this platform, last quarter, Hotstar had more than 300 million average monthly users, served an unprecedented 100 million daily users and delivered a high-quality streaming experience to 25.3 million simultaneous users, which is a new world record. The platform's broad array of premium sports rights will serve it well over the next five years especially as we expand the service into markets across Southeast Asia. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">At Walt Disney Television, the Fox acquisition brought us talented and experienced senior leadership who are now in place to produce much of the content we will rely on to implement our ambitious strategy. The studio capabilities, production expertise and valuable relationships with the creative community will be vital to our DTC plans while also overseeing ABC, ABC News, our own television stations, FX, Freeform, the Disney Channel and Nat Geo. National Geographic brings a strong global brand to our portfolio, along with world-class content for our television and DTC businesses. Disney+ will offer more than 600 hours of premium content from National Geographic at launch, along with almost 300 hours of family entertainment from the Fox Studios library. Disney+ will ultimately become the exclusive streaming service for our vast library of movies and series, National Geographic content, all upcoming Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars movies and a robust slate of high-quality original programming from the creative engines that drive our entire company. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">Regarding our suite of DTC services, I'm pleased to announce that in the United States, consumers will be able to subscribe to a bundle of Disney+, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu for $12.99 a month. The bundle will be available on our November 12 launch date. Before we take your questions, let me reiterate a few things. Today, much of our focus is on integrating Fox's assets and leveraging them, along with our Disney businesses, to move quickly into the direct-to-consumer space. Nothing is more important to us than getting this right. We remain confident in our strategy and our ability to successfully execute it, and as Christine noted, we still expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. We're clearly bullish on our future for good reasons. </p>, <p class=""p p5"">And on that note, Christine and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>, <p class=""p p5"" id=""question-answer-session""><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""question"">Alexia Quadrani</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Just two questions, if I may. First on the Fox integration. I know it's really early days, and you highlighted some areas of weakness 21CF had in the quarter but you also spoke about the opportunity of Fox and its IP presents longer term. I guess my question is any color how long it takes before the Disney imprint really impacts these assets? I assume it takes a while for the studio and the other assets to really -- you have to own them for a while before you really see the impact. And then my follow-up question is on the parks. Any color on how Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opening in Disneyland did versus your internal expectations and anything you learned from it in terms of the opening that you can sort of apply to Orlando's opening later this month?</p>, <p class=""p p5""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p5"">Sure, Alexia. Thank you. First of all, regarding Fox and the integration, I think what -- in terms of these results, aside from a lot of the ins and outs that Christine described like the cost of Cricket in India, et cetera, and so on and the impact of the Hulu deal, I think one of the biggest issues that we faced in this quarter in terms of the result -- of the earnings was the Fox Studio performance, which was well below where it had been and well below where we hoped it would be when we made the acquisition. Now understand, I've been through a number of these. First of all, I was bought twice. First at Capital Cities/ABC and then Disney bought ABC. And I know what happens when companies are purchased. Often, decision-making can grind to a halt or certainly slow down. We've managed to avoid that in the purchases of Pixar and Marvel and even Lucasfilm in part because between when we made the deal and when the deal closed was relatively short periods of time. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">In this case, we announced the deal first in December of '17, and we didn't close the deal until spring of 2019. And that's a long period of time for a business that relies on constant decision-making and constant attention to detail. And while I don't in any way mean to cast aspersions at any individuals at all, it was a very difficult transition for that business. And what we've done is we've put it under our studio, and you know the results there. They've been hard at work working primarily with Emma Watts on the live action side to redirect the efforts of the live action part of that business. First of all, to consolidate the cutback in the number of releases and then to focus on the kind of release that we would hope to come out of that studio. We like some of the movies that are coming up, notably there's one called Ford v Ferrari which we've all seen, which is great, but it will probably take a good solid year, maybe 2 years before we can have an impact, obviously takes longer on the development side but an impact on the films that are actually in production. But we're all confident that we're going to be able to turn around the fortunes of Fox live action, and you'll see those results in a couple of years. </p>, <p class=""p p6"">On Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge front, to give you some color, I think a number of things happened. First of all, helped in part by some of our efforts, there was tremendous concern in the marketplace that there was going to be huge crowding when we open Galaxy’s Edge. And so some people stayed away just because they expected that it would not be a great guest experience. The same time that was going on, all the local hotels in the region expecting a huge influx of visitation raised their prices. So it simply got more expensive to come stay in Anaheim. In addition to that, we raised our prices. We brought our daily price up, so if you think about local visitation, we brought the price of a one day ticket up substantially from a year ago. And then we opened up Galaxy’s Edge with one attraction instead of two, the second attraction is going to open in January. And so all of those factors contributed to attendance that was below what we would have hoped it would be. That said, guest satisfaction, interest in the attractions, in the land is extremely high. They're among the most popular thing at the Park. And so long term, look, we build these things for the long term, we have no concerns whatsoever about them. We're opening Galaxy’s Edge in August in Orlando. The second attraction there will open in December. And as I said, the second attraction in Anaheim will open in January. So we feel great about the product that we've created. It's just going to take some time for -- basically for things to work themselves out in terms of how the marketplace is reacting.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Alexia, I just want to put a little more granularity on the Disneyland results for the quarter. As I said, the attendance was down 3%, but the paid attendance was up in the quarter, and that lower attendance was primarily driven by the annual passholder visitation. And when we look at the per cap spend across Disneyland all categories, they were up significantly year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.</p>, <p class=""p p6""><strong><span class=""question"">Michael Nathanson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p6"">One for Bob and one for Christine. Bob, thanks for the update on the Hulu bundle. That's what we would have asked you. Another question on Hulu is any update on international rollout now that you have full control? That's one that people have been focused on. And then for Christine, I'm just confused a bit by what surprised you at Star. Because those Cricket contracts were known, so was it something more about the performance of those contracts that -- in terms of the ratings of that contract that surprised you? Anything more on India would be helpful. What disappointed you?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">We're not updating anything regarding Hulu internationally. Kevin Mayer and the team at Hulu are studying opportunities, along with our international team, market-by-market. Obviously, we have designs on growing Hulu outside of the United States but no update on that right now.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">And on Star, Michael, it was the quadrennial Cricket World Cup, of course. They have their Indian Premier League, which is ongoing, but this is once every four years for the World Cup. There were a couple of significant games that were rained out. They have insurance coverage for some of those, but any proceeds would be in future periods. And there was also some weakness in advertising revenue that was related to the local advertising market.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""question"">Jessica Reif Ehrlich</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Just a couple of different questions. But could you talk a little bit about the marketing for Disney+? With the launch less than three months to get -- away, you've talked at the Analyst Day about having 90%-plus awareness. Can you just -- I haven't seen marketing yet, so can you talk about the plan? Different topic but on all of the stuff that's going on in China as well as in Hong Kong, can you talk a little bit about -- or give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of impact on -- towards some of the parks and how it might be affecting pricing and future investment? And then one last kind of follow-up on the pricing. You did increase prices unusually, I think just -- I'm not sure if it's just Disneyland. Can you talk about how you're thinking about pricing going forward at the domestic parks?</p>, <p class=""p p7""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p7"">Disney+ marketing is going to start to hit in later this month, later in August. We're actually going to allow members of D23 to be the first to subscribe. I'm actually going through a comprehensive marketing plan with the team next week. Comprehensive probably is an understatement. It is going to be treated as the most important product that the company has launched in, I don't know, certainly during my tenure in the job, which is quite a long time. And you will see marketing both in traditional and nontraditional directions basically digital and analog also significant amount of support within the company on basically company platforms. And then of course all of the touch points that the company has, whether it's people staying in our hotels, people that have our co-branded credit card, people who are members of D23, annual passholders, I could go on and on. But the opportunities are tremendous to market this. And I feel good about some of the creative that I've already seen. But you won't start to see it until later this month. </p>, <p class=""p p7"">On the China front, to date, we have not seen any impact at all in Shanghai about the unrest that's going on in Hong Kong or from the trade issues between our countries. In Hong Kong, we have seen an impact from the protests. Obviously, they are significant in nature. And while the impact is not reflected in the results that we just announced, you can expect that we will feel it in the quarter that we're currently in, and we'll see how long the protests go on. But there's definitely been disruption that has impacted our visitation there.</p>, <p class=""p p7"">On the pricing side, as we've said a number of times, our pricing is designed to really accomplish a number of things. One is to reflect the value of the product that we have in the marketplace that includes the franchises and the popularity of them. And of course, the investments that we've made in these parks and resorts by continuing to build them out and continuing to create experiences that are better than many of those that we've had in the past. We also have tried very hard to protect guest experience, and so the pricing has been designed to make it more expensive in peak periods to manage that demand and less expensive or not as expensive in the nonpeak periods to make it more accessible. And for the most part, we've done a good job doing that. We know that demand on our product is so extraordinary in the peak periods that it just is in our better interest to manage crowding because it just affects guest satisfaction. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">At the same time that we have taken our prices up, our competition has actually been in the market discounting a little bit more. We've certainly seen that with Universal in Florida. And so the gap between what we did and where they've been maybe just a little greater than it's been, and perhaps that's had an impact. We obviously monitor these things very carefully. I try to explain what some of the pricing impact on Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was, but we do not feel that we have a pricing issue at our domestic parks. And that's reflected in basically not only current business but a fair amount of research that we've done.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""question"">Benjamin Swinburne</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Bob, as you get ready to launch Disney+, I'm wondering if you could update us on sort of the technical platform behind the product and kind of where that stands versus where it needs to be, scale a big business globally. And also your philosophy on distribution partnerships. You mentioned bundling Hulu and ESPN+ which certainly makes sense. But there's a lot of companies, as you're well aware of, out there sort of selling in a digital native environment like Amazon and Apple and others, lots of services like these. I'm just wondering if you could talk about your philosophy on utilizing those versus a pure direct-to-consumer business because those could certainly impact sort of how fast you get out of the gate. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">And then I just wanted to ask, Christine, you didn't mention the 21CF Television Studio, which I believe is in your broadcast segment. That's a business that I think you would acknowledge has been performing quite well for a long time. Any sense for how that's doing or how that impacted the quarter would be appreciated.</p>, <p class=""p p8""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p8"">Okay. On the second part of your question first, about basically digital distribution partners. At Investor Day, we announced that we had a few distribution partners. There are others out there, notably Apple and Amazon and Google, for instance, that we've been in discussions with about distribution. You can expect that we will conclude deals with them as distribution partners. We think it's important for us to achieve scale relatively quickly, and they'll be an important part of that. Nothing to announce specifically, except we've had conversations with all of them. They're all interested in distributing the product. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">On the tech side, we continue to look very carefully at the tech platform that we have. Obviously, we're using that platform for ESPN+. We continue to learn. We think we're most focused on not how robust it is because we believe we have that already, but we're most focused on the onboarding experience and making sure that people who sign up as subscribers for the service do so with incredible ease. We know how important it is to create a frictionless experience, and there's a lot of time being spent on that. I want to also say even though it wasn't part of your question that as we're dealing with distribution opportunities as well as what we just talked about, which is the tech and the sign-on or the onboarding side, there's a huge amount of work going on the production front. And I just want to touch on some of that. </p>, <p class=""p p8"">As you know, we're going to launch with a significant number of movie titles that -- from our studio that will be well over 300 on launch day and over 400 in year one, including the great slate that the studio has out in the marketplace now. By the way, those titles are significant in terms of their quality. For instance, there'll be eight Star Wars titles when we launch, 18 Pixars, 70 Disney Animation, 240 Disney live action, four Marvel and then followed by eight more Marvel in year one. So a lot of quality. And then over 7,500 episodes of Disney TV. We're augmenting all of that with a tremendous amount of original live action product and have actually screened a fair amount including the entire series of Mandalorians for Season 1, a number of the movies that we made including Togo and Lady and the Tramp and Noelle and Stargirl, and I can probably name a few others, and a lot of the other series product that we're making from Marvel, from Pixar, from Disney Channel, High School Musical another one. And I've been really impressed with the quality, with the variety and with the volume. So a tremendous amount going on, on that front. I'm convinced that we're going to launch with a tremendous array of intellectual property for people who are interested in National Geographic, Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars. And then on the studio front, Christine could take some of the particulars as it relates to the television side.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Okay. So 21st Century TV was a contributor in the quarter on an operating income basis. It had a more significant contribution on the cable side than the broadcast side. Although we did mention that there would be some headwinds in the fourth quarter, it will still be a positive contributor. It'll just be lower than it was year-over-year.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""question"">Todd Juenger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Picking up a little bit, I guess, on where Michael was. I really appreciate all the different lines of businesses and brands and how you're helping us to understand them. Can I ask a little bit about where Hulu Live fits into all of this in the states? Generally and just we've seen price increases at other places, how do you feel about profitability there? Just you're -- the fact that you're in the business now of being a MVPD and what that role that plays for Disney. That's question one. And question number two, not completely unrelated, I'm a little confused at how you're thinking about the live television brands like National Geographic and the Disney kids channels which will also exist on Disney+. Will all the content that -- especially the new content that's on the TV networks be available to Disney+ subscribers? Is there a windowing philosophy same way going backwards? How do you manage that so that consumers of both products feel like they're getting the full benefit of those brands?</p>, <p class=""p p9""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p9"">Good question. No. We're negotiating with a number of MVPDs right now to extend our linear or live, as you called them, television channels. And these remain important deals to us and important businesses to us as well. And obviously, that includes ABC and Disney Channel, and you mentioned Nat Geo and Freeform and FX to name a few. So it is important for us to continue to fuel those channels with enough quality, enough original programming to support the business as they exist today. We also know that if you look at all the disruption in our business, the business that's probably being impacted the most is that live multichannel television product. And so the pivot to the direct-to-consumer business is designed to not only address the opportunity that exists in that space, but to address the challenge that exists on the traditional side of the business, which means that we have our own balancing act to do in terms of fueling both sides, the traditional side and the new side or the direct-to-consumer business with enough quality product to succeed in both places.</p>, <p class=""p p9"">Obviously, what we also are doing is setting ourselves up in a way that we can be resilient, probably more resilient than any of our competitors should the traditional side erode so significantly that it's not as viable as it has been as a business. And that would enable us to pivot pretty quickly by moving even more product from the traditional channels over to the nontraditional channels. So it's -- as I said, it's a balancing act. We believe that we're making enough quality product for both sides right now to feel confident about both sides of the business. The windowing strategy essentially is that we are taking a lot of product that we're making for the traditional channels and ultimately moving it onto the nontraditional. But we're also making, as you know, original product for the new channel, the Disney+ and Hulu, that will not go back onto the other channels. But although in some cases, it might. Just to give you an idea, we'd be making FX shows for Hulu that might premiere on Hulu but ultimately end up on the linear channels is one example of that. So we're going to look at variety of different opportunities and just make sure that there's enough content flowing in both directions for the businesses to be successful. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">On the Hulu Live front, we felt it was important to do what we can to grow digital MVPD businesses. We obviously know that there are others in the space that have been good partners to us. YouTube would be one to mention. We like the fact that Hulu is out there with a product that is very unique, in that it gives subscribers an opportunity to buy linear television, digital over-the-top linear television, to buy off network programming because we know the deals, the content licensing deals that they have with the networks, and to buy original programming. And that combination of all three puts Hulu in a very unique place, in that there's really no one out there that's offering the comprehensive television offering the way Hulu is. And we'll continue to stay at it. </p>, <p class=""p p10"">The other thing to note by the way is Hulu has grown -- is it's also developed into a very, very important advertising business. And when you think about advertisers who are looking to reach clients on digital platforms, Hulu offers a great opportunity to do that. To what extent those live channels will enable the opportunity on -- to sell advertising along with the advertising that is sold and the programming that's made just for Hulu is another story. But it's a big part and a growing part of that business.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">And one more thing on Hulu Live, the digital platform grew the most of any DMVPD this quarter.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Marci Ryvicker</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Just I have one for Christine. There are so many moving pieces at the moment. Can you just talk about your leverage target? Has this changed at all in terms of the actual target or when you expect to get there? And then maybe comment on your free cash flow priorities and how should we think about the timing on the return to share repurchases.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Sure. Our target has not changed, Marci. We're still targeting a mid-single A target. We have an ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies. They understand our strategy. They understand what it takes to get there. And the overall pivot in our strategy has been multiyear, and I would say it's been capped off with the acquisition of 21st Century assets. And we will be meeting with them, but our attitude towards share repurchase has always been once we invest in our businesses and we make any acquisitions as we see fit, we look at our dividend capacity. And if all of those still result in excess cash for us, we will return it to shareholders. I don't think you should anticipate that happening in the near future because we're still in an investment mode as it relates to our direct-to-consumer activities, and that's what we're really focused on right now.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Crédit Suisse.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""question"">Douglas Mitchelson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Bob, I guess two questions. First, I think there's a lot of familiarity sort of with everyone listening on the call as to the U.S. prospects of the Disney+ service and what marketing you might do in the competitive environment. Is international different? I mean you talked about bundling with Hulu in the U.S., but that's not something you can do overseas. So I just love to hear how you're approaching international marketing and sort of the early prospects for the service overseas to the extent it's different in the United States. And then I have a second question on content distribution strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p10""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p10"">Well, we will launch in international markets very quickly. I think two actually are going to launch when we launch Disney+ around the same time. And then over the next two to three years, we're going to roll out a number of other markets. So you're right, a number of those markets are different than the United States. But what they do share, which is very, very important, is an interest in Marvel, Pixar, Disney, National Geographic and Star Wars. So the product that's being made for the platforms travels globally, and that's a big deal. We will have to augment it in certain markets with local programming to meet quotas that are now being applied to OTT services. And we're also going to enter into discussions on an international basis market-by-market with local distributors as well. We're already in those discussions actually. </p>, <p class=""p p11"">And so we don't have anything to announce right now in terms of new markets that we're going to launch in. But it's safe to assume that we're going to launch in multiple international markets within two years, certainly within three years, of launch in the United States, in a couple of other markets.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Douglas Mitchelson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And I guess on content distribution, you talked about fueling the traditional channels versus fueling your OTT services and obviously a third area is selling programming to third-party SVOD services. And I'm sort of curious overseas, I know Hulu international is off-limit. To the extent you're trying to drive Fox profitability to the point where it's accretive to fiscal '21, do you need to continue to sell programming into SVOD windows overseas? And the reason I obviously ask is I'm wondering if at some point you'll start warehousing content that would go into a Hulu international service.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">I think on the Fox front, meaning or we'll call it non-Disney Pixar-branded type product or Star Wars, we'll continue to license to third parties overseas to reap the benefits of the revenue that we could derive from those sales. Until such time as we believe a launch in that market is imminent, in which case, we'll pivot in a whole product for us. We're even going to do that to a lesser extent, a far lesser extent, with some of the Disney content as well until we're ready to launch in a market. We may license some of that content to third parties, too, to continue to drive revenue.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Douglas Mitchelson</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Should we assume shorter-term deals than you might have done historically?</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Yes. Yes. Clearly, when we do such deals, we're going to do so to avoid the encumbrances that would make it impossible or difficult for us to put the product on our platform once we launch.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Kannan Venkateshwar</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">So Bob, one question for you on the content front, which is when you think about the balance between quality and quantity, how much content from a volume perspective is enough? How much is too much? I mean how are you thinking about the long-term targets in terms of content volumes? And how do you balance that? And Christine, from your perspective on the marketing side, I think you mentioned Q3 is where we might see some of those spend coming in, Q3 and Q4. Will this all be expensed upfront? Or will this be amortized over time? Would be great if you could help us with that.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">As we said, Kannan, on Investor Day and we said a few times, given the fact that the Disney+ product is Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, Nat Geographic, I mentioned it 8,000 times, we feel that we can focus more on quality than on quantity. But we obviously know we need enough quantity under each brand umbrella to drive subscribers who are primarily interested in those brands. And so obviously if you compare us to Netflix, we're going to have far less products than they do, but we're lying on the strength of our brands and the fervor that fans of those brands have for the product that we make under those brand umbrellas.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""answer"">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">And on the marketing side, Kannan, in my comments, I mentioned marketing, but that was related to 21CF's film studio that they had some marketing in the third quarter for movies that would be released in fourth quarter. But I'm assuming your question really is related to marketing that would go along with the launch of Disney+. And as far as that's concerned, we will be expensing those marketing costs as we incur them.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Our last question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi.</p>, <p class=""p p11""><strong><span class=""question"">Jason Bazinet</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p11"">Just a question for Mr. Iger. In the fullness of time as your DTC strategy plays out, do you think Hulu will be a more important app or financial driver than Disney+? And the reason I ask is I understand the elements that Fox brought to the Disney+ app, The Simpsons, Nat Geo and some of those Marvel characters. But those seem sort of small in the context of the amount of money that you spent to acquire Fox. And so it sort of hints that something bigger is afoot in terms of your overall strategy.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong><span class=""answer"">Robert Iger</span></strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Well, we obviously, in analyzing the assets from 21st Century Fox that we bought, placed a lot of value on the Hulu stake that we were getting. And that obviously was also reflected in the deal that we did with Comcast, where the value of their stake has been public since we announced that deal. So Hulu will play an important part in our future as a platform for the non-so-called family-like programming that will be on Disney+. And that will be fueled not just by library that we bought from Fox, and that library is both movie and television library, but by a tremendous amount of television production capabilities. So when you think about what the -- our company today and the creative engines, we obviously have a movie studio that includes now Fox live action and Fox Searchlight, we have -- and along with all the Disney assets. We have a sprawling television business that includes ABC, Disney Channel, FX, Nat Geo, Freeform, et cetera, and so on, and the television business or unit that we created under Peter Rice has now been structured to produce original product for all of the platforms, both the linear platforms, the traditional MVPD channels, as well as the new platforms, notably Hulu. So there will be an increase in production activity of the company under that unit producing products specifically for Hulu. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">And so as we see it, our play in the digital OTT space ultimately globally, but we're going to start as we've said more domestically, is to have general entertainment, we'll call it Hulu, more family-like entertainment, which is Disney+, and sports. And that bundle that we're creating, that $12.99 bundle, where you can buy all three offers consumers tremendous volume, tremendous quality and tremendous variety for a good price.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Lowell Singer</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">And thank you, Jason, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">In our remarks, we provided estimates of the performance of certain 21CF assets and compared it to the prior year. These estimates are based on an analysis of 21CF record but are nonetheless unaudited estimates and are not precise measures of historical results before the acquisition. </p>, <p class=""p p12"">Let me also remind you that certain statements on this call including financial estimates may constitute forward-looking statements under the securities laws.

Have a great day, everyone.</p>, <p class=""p p12""><strong>Operator</strong></p>, <p class=""p p12"">Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.
